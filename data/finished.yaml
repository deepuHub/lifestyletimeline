      content: "Modern Face Recognition with Deep Learning:- Machine learning people call the 128 measurements of each face an embedding. Encoding our face image This process of training a convolutional neural network to output face embeddings requires a lot of data and computer power. Even with an expensive NVidia Telsa video card, it takes about 24 hours of continuous training to get good accuracy. But once the network has been trained, it can generate measurements for any face, even ones it has never seen before! So this step only needs to be done once. Lucky for us, the fine folks at OpenFace already did this and they published several trained networks which we can directly use. Thanks Brandon Amos and team!"

Deep learning researchers who know almost nothing about language translation are throwing together relatively simple machine learning solutions that are beating the best expert-built language translation systems in the world. The technology behind this breakthrough is called sequence-to-sequence learning. It’s very powerful technique that be used to solve many kinds problems. After we see how it is used for translation, we’ll also learn how the exact same algorithm can be used to write AI chat bots and describe pictures. Let’s go!"

This double-translated text is called parallel corpora. In the same way that the Rosetta Stone was used by scientists in the 1800s to figure out Egyptian hieroglyphs from Greek, computers can use parallel corpora to guess how to convert text from one language to another."

      content: "Encoding: This is our encoding. It lets us represent something very complicated (a picture of a face) with something simple (128 numbers). Now comparing two different faces is much easier because we only have to compare these 128 numbers for each face instead of comparing full images. Guess what? We can do the same thing with sentences! We can come up with an encoding that represents every possible different sentence as a series of unique numbers. Because the RNN has a “memory” of each word that passed through it, the final encoding it calculates represents all the words in the sentence."
    - page: "5" 
      content: "Here’s where things get really cool! What if we took two RNNs and hooked them up end-to-end? The first RNN could generate the encoding that represents a sentence. Then the second RNN could take that encoding and just do the same logic in reverse to decode the original sentence again. Of course being able to encode and then decode the original sentence again isn’t very useful. But what if (and here’s the big idea!) we could train the second RNN to decode the sentence into Spanish instead of English? We could use our parallel corpora training data to train it to do that."

      content: "To turn this sound wave into numbers, we just record of the height of the wave at equally-spaced points: This is called sampling. We are taking a reading thousands of times a second and recording a number representing the height of the sound wave at that point in time. That’s basically all an uncompressed .wav audio file is. CD Quality audio is sampled at 44.1khz (44,100 readings per second). But for speech recognition, a sampling rate of 16khz (16,000 samples per second) is enough to cover the frequency range of human speech."

      content: "Pre-processing our Sampled Sound Data: A spectrogram is cool because you can actually see musical notes and other pitch patterns in audio data.

      content: "Prof. Kotovsky: But by creating brahmanas from different social classes of society, you deny the old prescription of the Hindu scriptures. Srila Prabhupada: No, I establish it. Prof. Kotovsky: According to all scriptures—the Purtinas, etc.—everymember of one of these four classes of varnas has to be born within it. §rila Prabhupada: No, no, no, no. Prof. Kotovsky: That is the foundation of all the varnas- §rila Prabhupada: No, no. I am sorry. Prof. Kotovsky: The foundation of all the varnas- §rila PrabhupAda: You have spoken incorrectly. With great respect I be to submit that you are not speaking correctly. In the  Bhagavad-gita [4.13] it is stated, aitur-varnyarii mays srstath guna-karma-vibhagagah: These four orders of brahmanas, Icsatriyas, vain as, and gadras were created by Me according to quality and work. There is no mention of birth. Prof. Kotovsky: I agree withyou that this is the addition of later briihmanas who tried to perpetuate these qualities. Sala Prabhupada: That has killed theIndian culture. Otherwise there would have been no necessity of the division of part of India into Pakistan."

      content: "It is not a religious faith. Religious faith you can -c-han-g—e, but real dharma you cannot change. Try to understand Krsna. In the Bhagavad-gita [18.66] He says, sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekath garanath vraja: Give up all other forms of religion and just surrender to Me. That is real knowl-edge—to surrender to the Supreme. You or I—anyone—is surrendered to someone. That is a fact. Our life is by surrender, is it not? Do you disagree with this point? Prof. Kotovsky: To some extent you surrender. §rila Prabhupacla: Yes, to the full extent. Prof. Kotovsky: You have to surrender to the society, for instance. To the whole people. §rila Prabhupacla: Yes, to the whole people, or to the state or to the king or the government or whatever you say. This surrender must be there. Prof. Kotovsky: The only difficulty is that we cannot half surrender to a government or a king. The principal difference is of surrender to a king, to a person, or to the society. §rila Prabhupacla: No, that is only a change of color. But the principle of surrender is there. Whether you surrender to monarchy, demoracy, ar-istocracy, or dictatorship, you have to surrender; that is a fact. cWithout surrender there is no life. It is not possible. So we are educating people to surrender to the Supreme, wherefrom you get all protection, just as Krsna says (sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam §arahath vraja). No one can say, No, I am not surrendered to anyone. Not a single person. The difference is where he surrenders. The ultimate surrendering object is Krsna. There-to in the Bhagavad-gita [7.19] Krsna says, bahanartz janmanam ante frianavcin re  math prapadyate: After surrendering to so many things birth after birth, when one is factually wise he surrenders unto Me. Vasudevait sarvam iti sa mahatma sudurlabhah: Such a mahatma is very rare. Prof. Kotovsky: But at the same time it seems to me that surrender is to be accompanied by revolt. The history of mankind has proved that mankind has developed only by revolt against some kind of surrender the medieval age there was the French Revolution. It was revolt against  surrender. But this revolution itself was surrender to the rank and file of the people. You are agreed? Srila Prabhupada: Yes. Prof. Kotovsky: So it is not enough to come to a full stop. Surrender is to be accompanied with revolt against some and surrender to other people,. Prabhupada: But the surrender will be fully stopped when it is surrender to Krsna. . .  Prof. Kotovsky: Ah, ah. Prabhupicia: That is full stop—no more surrender. Any other sur-render you have to change by revolution. But when you come to Krsna, then it is sufficient. You are satisfied. I'll give you an example: a child is crying, and people move him from one lap to another. Oh, he does not stop. But as soon as the baby comes to the lap of his mother—Prof. Kotovsky: It stops. Srila Prabhupada: Yes, full satisfaction. So this surrender, these changes, will go on in different categories. But the sum total of all this surrender is surrender to maya. Therefore, in the Bhagavad-gita it is said that this sur-render, neglecting Krsna, is all maya. Either you surrender to this or to that, but final surrender is surrender to Krsna; then you will be happy. The process of surrender is there, but surrender to Krsna keeps one quite satisfied, transcendentally."

      content: "Srila Prabhupada: No, no. This is organized by the Englishmen and Americans. The Indian communities in London and San Francisco are trying to become—you know the word? Sahib? Prof. Kotovsky: [Laughs.] Westernized. [They both laugh.] A very great social anthropologist at the university has written something very inter-esting. He says there are two processes—the process of Westernization among bra-hirianas, mainly the upper class, and the process called Sanskritization, which is the process of adopting brahmana rituals, etc., by so-called lower classes, even untouchables. It is a very interesting process in India just now. But India's position, unfortunately, is problematic. Srila Prabhupada: The difficulty is that India is nowhere. They are trying to imitate Western life, but from a materialistic or technical point of view, they are one hundred years back. Prof. Kotovsky: Yes, that is right. But what to do for India? Srila Prabhupada: There is one thing I am experiencing. If India's spiri-tual asset is distributed, that will increase India's honor. Because every-where I go, people still adore Indian culture. If this treasure-house of India's spiritual knowledge is properly distributed, at least people outside of India will understand that they are getting something from India. Prof. Kotovsky: Of course, you're right. The Indian cultural heritage is to be made known everywhere. But at the same time, in what way would this benefit the Indian masses themselves? They are sitting in India, and they have nothing to gain from the spreading of the Indian cultural heritage all over the world. Indian villages have to have fertilizers, tractors, etc. Srila Prabhupada: Yes, we do not object to that."

They simply observe and then speak nonsense. Scientists say that the chemicals are the cause of life."

      content: "'BUILD YOUR NATIONS ON THE SPIRITUAL PLATFORM' Srila Prabhupada addresses students, faculty, and government officials at the University of Nairobi in September 1972: 'You are trying to develop yourselves so please develop spiritually, for spiritual development is sound development' Don't imitate the Americans and Europeans, who are living like cats an'd dogs. . . . The atomic bomb is already there, and as soon as the next war breaks out, all their skyscrapers and everything else will be finished. Try to understand this from the real viewpoint of human life, the spiritual viewpoint.' Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for kindly coming here to participate in this meeting for spreading Ki-sna consciousness. The Krsna consciousness movement is trying to bring human society to the point where everyone's life can become successful. The subject today is the real meaning of human life. We are trying to instruct the entire world about this meaning. Human life is attained after many, many millions of years species of life according to the Padma Purana. Life began with the aquatics, for we can understand from Vedic literature that at the beginning of creation the entire planet was merged in water. This material world is composed of five gross elements—earth, water, fire, air, and ether. Besides these there are three subtle elements—mind, intelligence, and ego. Behind these curtains is the spirit soul, which is covered by these eight elements. This informa-tion is given in the Bhagavad-gita. Human beings are not the only living entities to have a spirit soul. We are all spirit souls—beasts, birds, reptiles, insects, trees, plants, aquatics, and so on. The spirit soul is simply covered by different dresses, just as some of you are dressed in white clothes, some in green, some in red, etc. But we are not concerned with the dress; we are concerned with you as spirit soul. Thus it is said in the Bhagavad-gita [5.18]."

      content: "In Vedic scriptures such as the Narada-paricartitra and the Srimad Bhfigavatam. These two books, and the Bhagavad-gita, are very authentic scriptures meant for devotees. Caitanya Mahaprabhu quotes from a versa in the Mirada-pan-carat/7r hrsikeija hrsike§a-sevanarh bhaktir ucyate. This i the definition of pure devotional service. Hrsikena hrsikega-sevanam. Hrsikena means 'by one's senses.' We have to engage our senses; it is not that we engage only our minds. If someone says, 'I am always thinking of Krsna' that is not pure devotional service. Meditation is thinking, but no one thinks of Krsna; they think of void or something impersonal. If someone is thinking of Krsna or Narayana or Visnu, as prescribed in the Vedic scriptures, that is real yoga; yoga meditation means to focus one's mind upon the Supersoul. The Supersoul is the representation of Krsna in the form of four-handed Narayana. Even Patatijali, an authority on the yoga system, prescribes meditation on Visnu. But just as people are manu-facturing bogus religious processes, the so-called yogis of today have manufactured their own way of thinking of something void. But the Narada-paficartitra says, hrsikena hrsike§a-sevanam: one must engage not only one's mind but one's senses. Engage the senses in the service of the master of the senses. These three Sanskrit words are very significant. Hrsikena means 'the Lord of the senses.' So bhakti-yoga means to serve with the senses the Lord of the senses. The Lord of the senses is Krsna. We should always remember that we have our senses because we wanted to enjoy this material world, and therefore the Lord has given us a particular set of senses for our enjoyment. "

      content: "REACHING LIFE'S PERFECTION 277 Prahlada Maharaja was offered whatever he liked, he had only to ask for it, but he said, 'My Lord, I am Your eternal servant. It is my duty to serve You, so how can I accept any benefit from it? Then I would not be Your servant; I would be a merchant.' He replied in that way, and that is the sign of a pure person. Krsna is so kind that He fulfills all the desires of a devotee, even if he wants material benedictions. If at the bot-tom of the devotee's heart there is some desire, He also fulfills that. He is so kind. But the sublime position of bhakti-yoga, or devotional service, is that a pure devotee refuses to accept the various kinds of liberation, even if offered by the Supreme Lord. If one has material desires or motives within himself, and for fulfill-ment of such desires he engages himself in devotional service, the result will be that he will never get pure love of God."

      content: "Rupa Gosvami was very glad that Krsna had sent so many things and that he could now prepare a feast. He pi pared a feast and then invited his elder brother. When Sanatana Gosvami came, he was astonished. 'How have yc secured such things? You have prepared such a nice feast in this fore5 How is it possible?' So Riipa Gosvami explained, 'In the morning I desired for it, and b chance Krsna sent me all these things. A nice girl came, and she offere it to me.' He was describing the girl: 'A very nice girl.' Then Sanatana said, 'This nice girl is Radharani. You have taken servic from Radharani, the Lord's eternal consort. It is a great blunder.' That i their philosophy. They would not accept service from the Lord. They sim ply wanted to render service. But Krsna is so clever that He also wants tc serve His devotee. He looks for an opportunity to serve His devotee. Thi! is spiritual competition. A pure devotee does not want anything from Krsna; he simply wants to serve Him. And Krsna also looks for the oppor-tunity to serve His devotee. Krsna is always as anxious to please His devo-tee as the devotee is to please Him. This is the transcendental world. On the absolute plane, there is no exploitation. Everyone wants to serve; no one wants to take service. In the transcendental world, everyone wants to give service. You want to give service to me, and I want to give service to you. This is such a nice attitude. This material world means that I want to pickpocket you, and you want to pickpocket me. That's all. This is the material world. We should try to understand it. In the material world, everyone wants to exploit his friend, his father, his mother, everyone. But in the transcendental world, every-e wants to serve. Everyone has Krsna as the central point of serving."

      content: "A pure devotee's position is that he has no enemy because he is not envious. A pure devo-tee is always open to everyone, and he does not discriminate that this person can be allowed to chant Hare Krsna and that person should not be allowed. On the material platform, which is a platform of dualism, there are differences between high and low, man and woman, and this or that, but on the spiritual platform there are no such distinctions. The pure devotee, seeing everything with an equal mind, is therefore nonenvious. Because he is nonenvious, he is worshipable. Indeed, it may even be said that a person is worshipable simply if he is nonenvious, for it is only possible to be nonenvious on the spiritual platform. This is also the ver-dict of the Bhagavad-gita [5.18-19]: 'vidya-vinaya-sampanne brahmane gavi hastini guni caiva §vapake ca panclitalj sama-darginah ihaiva tair jitatj sargo yesarh samye sthitarh manalj nirdosarii hi samarh brahma tasmad brahmani to sthiteilj' The humble sages, by virtue of true knowledge, see with equal vision a learned and gentle brahmana, a cow, an elephant, a dog, and a dog-eater. Those whose minds are established in sameness and equanimity have already conquered the conditions of birth and death. They are flawless like Brahman, and thus they are already situated in Brahman.'"

      content: "Therefore Krsna says that worship of His devotee is even more valuable than worship of Him-self. The devotee is actually able to deliver Krsna, for he knows the science of Krsna consciousness, the science of hearing Krsna's words, eating krsna-prasaadam, and enjoying Krsna."

      content: "The underlying principle of devotional service is unalloyed love for Krsna. Regardless of the position of a particular devotee—as friend, ser-vant, parent, or lover of Krsna—his service is unconditional, for Krsna consciousness is not dependent on any material condition. It is transcen-dental and has nothing to do with the modes of material nature. A devo-tee is not afraid to go anywhere, and because of this he sees all material conditions as equal. In the world we may say that this is a good place to be and that is a bad place, but, as pointed out before, the devotee is not subject to these mental concoctions. For him the basic principle of ma-terial existence is bad, for material existence means forgetfulness of Krsna."

      content: "REACHING LIFE'S PERFECTION 287 One who realizes that God is full in six opulences actually begins rendering service. As soon as one becomes aware of the greatness of Krsna and understands Krsna's superiority, his service begins. The awareness of God's greatness increases when tran-scendental service is rendered. A person who serves the Lord in order to satisfy the senses of the Lord becomes satisfied, because Krsna is the Supersoul and the individual living entity is His part and parcel. If He is satisfied, then the living entity is satisfied. If the stomach is satisfied, then all the parts of the body are satisfied, for they receive nourishment through the stomach. When one of my Godbrothers began to fan my Guru Maharaja on a very hot day, Guru Maharaja asked, 'Why are you fanning me all of a sudden?' The boy replied, 'Because if you are satisfied, we are all satisfied.' This is the formula—we should not try to satisfy our senses separately, but should try to satisfy Krsna's senses. Then naturally we will become satisfied."

      content: "As far as the individual soul is concerned, it is originally a part and parcel of this pleasure potency, of the reservoir of pleasure Himself. However, due to contact with material nature, the soul has forgotten its actual position and has become trapped in the evolutionary process of transmigration from one body to another. Thus one struggles hard for existence. Now we must extricate ourselves from the sufferings of the struggle, from the countless transmigrations that force us to suffer the miseries of birth, old age, disease, and death, and come to the point of our eternal life in Krsna consciousness. That eternal life is possible. If one tries his best in this human form of life, in his next life he will get a spiritual body. The spiritual body is already within the gross material body, but it will develop only as soon as one becomes free from the contamination of this material existence. That is the aim of human life and the actual self-interest of all people. Self-interest is actually realizing, 'I am part and parcel of God. I have to return to the kingdom of God and join with Him.' Just as we have a social life here, God has a social life in the spiritual king-dom, and we can join Him there. It is not that after finishing this body we become void. In the Bhagavad-gita [2.12] Krsna told Arjuna, 'Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings, nor in the future shall any of us cease to be.' Our existence is therefore eternal, and the changes of birth and death are simply the changes of the temporary material bodies."

      content: "AN INTRODUCTION TO ISKCON 309 The basic principle of the Hare Krsna way of life is 'simple living and high thinking.' Devotees of Krsna are encour-aged to use their time, energy, talents, and resources in devotional service to God, and not to hanker for selfish ambitions or pleasures, which result in frustration and anxiety. To cultivate their inherent spiritual qualities of compassion, truthful-ness, cleanliness, and austerity, devotees follow four regulative principles, which also help them control the insatiable urges of the mind and senses. These principles are: 1. No eating of meat, fish, or eggs. 2. No gambling. 3. No sex other than for procreation within marriage. 4. No intoxicants, including all recreational drugs, alcohol, tobacco, tea, and coffee. According to the Bhagavad-gita and other Vedic literature, indulgence in the above activities disrupts our physical, mental, and spiritual well-being and increases anxiety and conflict in society."
    - page: "9"
      content: "A Philosophy for Everyone The philosophy of the Hare Krsna movement (a monotheistic tradition) is summarized in the following eight points: 1. By sincerely cultivating the authentic spiritual science presented in the Bhagavad-gita and other Vedic scriptures, we can become free from anxiety and achieve a state of pure, unending, blissful consciousness. 2. Each of us is not the material body but an eternal spirit soul, part and parcel of God (Krsna). As such, we are all the eternal servants of Krsna and are interrelated through Him, our common father. 3. Krsna is the eternal, all-knowing, omnipresent, all-powerful, and all-attractive Personality of Godhead. He is the seed-giving father of all living beings and the sustaining energy of the universe. He is the source of all incarnations of God, including Lord Buddha and Lord Jesus Christ. 4. The Vedas are the oldest scriptures in the world. The essence of the Vedas is found in the Bhagavad-gita, a literal record of Krsna's words spoken five thousands years ago in India. The goal of Vedic knowledge—and of all religions—is to achieve love of God. 5. We can perfectly understand the knowledge of self-realization through the instructions of a genuine spiritual master—one who is free from selfish motives, who teaches the science of God explained in the Bhagavad-gita, and whose mind is firmly fixed in meditation on Krsna. 6. All that we eat should first be offered to Lord Krsna with a prayer. In this way Krsna accepts the offering and blesses it for our purification. 7. Rather than living in a self-centered way, we should act for the plea-sure of Lord Krsna. This is known as bhakti-yoga, the science of devotional service. 8. The most effective means for achieving God consciousness in this Age of Kali, or quarrel, is to chant the holy names of the Lord: Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare."

Limiting WIP also makes it easier to see problems that prevent the completion of work.[†] For instance, when we limit WIP, we find that we may have nothing to do because we are waiting on someone else. Although it may be tempting to start new work (i.e., “It’s better to be doing something than nothing'), a far better action would be to find something than nothing'), a far better action would be to find out what is causing the delay and help fix that problem. Bad multitasking often occurs when people are assigned to multiple projects, resulting in many prioritization problems. In other words, as David J. Andersen, author of Kanban: Successful Evolutionary Change for Your Technology Business, quipped, “Stop starting. Start finishing.'"

We do this by making work visible, limiting WIP, reducing batch sizes and the number of handoffs, continually identifying and evaluating our constraints, and eliminating hardships in our daily work."

Feedback is critical because it is what allows us to steer. We must constantly validate between customer needs, our intentions and our implementations. Testing is merely one sort of feedback.'"

      content: "Swarming is necessary for the following reasons: It prevents the problem from progressing downstream, where the cost and effort to repair it increases exponentially and technical debt is allowed to accumulate. It prevents the work center from starting new work, which will likely introduce new errors into the system. If the problem is not addressed, the work center could potentially have the same problem in the next operation (e.g., fifty-five seconds later), requiring more fixes and work. See Appendix 6. This practice of swarming seems contrary to common management practice, as we are deliberately allowing a local problem to disrupt operations globally. However, swarming enables learning. Changes that pass our continuous build and integration tests are deployed into production, and any changes that cause any tests to fail trigger our Andon cord and are swarmed until resolved. Astonishingly, when the number of Andon cord pulls drop, plant managers will actually decrease the tolerances to get an increase in the number of Andon cord pulls in order to continue to enable more learnings and improvements and to detect ever-weaker failure signals."

      content: "CONCLUSION Creating fast feedback is critical to achieving quality, reliability, and safety in the technology value stream. We do this by seeing problems as they occur, swarming and solving problems to build new knowledge, pushing quality closer to the source, and continually optimizing for downstream work centers. The specific practices that enable fast flow in the DevOps value stream are presented in Part IV."

We reserve time for the improvement of daily work and to further accelerate and ensure learning. We consistently introduce stress into our systems to force continual improvement. We even simulate and inject failures in our production services under controlled conditions to increase our resilience."

The NR is known for their intense commitment to scripted procedures and standardized work, and the need for incident reports for any departure from procedure or normal operations to accumulate learnings, no matter how minor the failure signal—they constantly update procedures and system designs based on these learnings. By relentless and constant experimentation in their daily work, they were able to continually increase capacity, often without adding any new equipment or hiring more people."

It also requires institutionalizing the improvement of daily work, converting local learnings into global learnings that can be used by the entire organization, as well as continually injecting tension into our daily work."

Their goal was to demonstrate early wins, which would give everyone confidence that these improvements could be replicated in other areas of the organization. How exactly that would be achieved was still unknown. They focused on three areas: the customer mobile application, their in-store restaurant systems, and their digital properties. Each of these areas had business goals that weren't being met; thus, they were more receptive to considering a different way of working."

Brownfield DevOps projects, these are existing products or services that are already serving customers and have potentially been in operation for years or even decades. Although many believe that DevOps is primarily for greenfield projects, DevOps has been used to successfully transform brownfield projects of all sorts. Indeed, one of the findings in the 2015 State of DevOps Report validated that the age of the application was not a significant predictor of performance; instead, what predicted performance was whether the application was architected (or could be re-architected) for testability and deployability."

We do this by breaking up our larger improvement goals into small, incremental steps. This not only creates our improvements faster, it also enables us to discover when we have made the wrong choice of value stream—by detecting our errors early, we can quickly back up and try again, making different decisions armed with our new learnings."
