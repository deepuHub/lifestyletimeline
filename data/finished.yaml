      content: "Modern Face Recognition with Deep Learning:- Machine learning people call the 128 measurements of each face an embedding. Encoding our face image This process of training a convolutional neural network to output face embeddings requires a lot of data and computer power. Even with an expensive NVidia Telsa video card, it takes about 24 hours of continuous training to get good accuracy. But once the network has been trained, it can generate measurements for any face, even ones it has never seen before! So this step only needs to be done once. Lucky for us, the fine folks at OpenFace already did this and they published several trained networks which we can directly use. Thanks Brandon Amos and team!"

Deep learning researchers who know almost nothing about language translation are throwing together relatively simple machine learning solutions that are beating the best expert-built language translation systems in the world. The technology behind this breakthrough is called sequence-to-sequence learning. It’s very powerful technique that be used to solve many kinds problems. After we see how it is used for translation, we’ll also learn how the exact same algorithm can be used to write AI chat bots and describe pictures. Let’s go!"

This double-translated text is called parallel corpora. In the same way that the Rosetta Stone was used by scientists in the 1800s to figure out Egyptian hieroglyphs from Greek, computers can use parallel corpora to guess how to convert text from one language to another."

      content: "Encoding: This is our encoding. It lets us represent something very complicated (a picture of a face) with something simple (128 numbers). Now comparing two different faces is much easier because we only have to compare these 128 numbers for each face instead of comparing full images. Guess what? We can do the same thing with sentences! We can come up with an encoding that represents every possible different sentence as a series of unique numbers. Because the RNN has a “memory” of each word that passed through it, the final encoding it calculates represents all the words in the sentence."
    - page: "5" 
      content: "Here’s where things get really cool! What if we took two RNNs and hooked them up end-to-end? The first RNN could generate the encoding that represents a sentence. Then the second RNN could take that encoding and just do the same logic in reverse to decode the original sentence again. Of course being able to encode and then decode the original sentence again isn’t very useful. But what if (and here’s the big idea!) we could train the second RNN to decode the sentence into Spanish instead of English? We could use our parallel corpora training data to train it to do that."

      content: "To turn this sound wave into numbers, we just record of the height of the wave at equally-spaced points: This is called sampling. We are taking a reading thousands of times a second and recording a number representing the height of the sound wave at that point in time. That’s basically all an uncompressed .wav audio file is. CD Quality audio is sampled at 44.1khz (44,100 readings per second). But for speech recognition, a sampling rate of 16khz (16,000 samples per second) is enough to cover the frequency range of human speech."

      content: "Pre-processing our Sampled Sound Data: A spectrogram is cool because you can actually see musical notes and other pitch patterns in audio data.

      content: "Prof. Kotovsky: But by creating brahmanas from different social classes of society, you deny the old prescription of the Hindu scriptures. Srila Prabhupada: No, I establish it. Prof. Kotovsky: According to all scriptures—the Purtinas, etc.—everymember of one of these four classes of varnas has to be born within it. §rila Prabhupada: No, no, no, no. Prof. Kotovsky: That is the foundation of all the varnas- §rila Prabhupada: No, no. I am sorry. Prof. Kotovsky: The foundation of all the varnas- §rila PrabhupAda: You have spoken incorrectly. With great respect I be to submit that you are not speaking correctly. In the  Bhagavad-gita [4.13] it is stated, aitur-varnyarii mays srstath guna-karma-vibhagagah: These four orders of brahmanas, Icsatriyas, vain as, and gadras were created by Me according to quality and work. There is no mention of birth. Prof. Kotovsky: I agree withyou that this is the addition of later briihmanas who tried to perpetuate these qualities. Sala Prabhupada: That has killed theIndian culture. Otherwise there would have been no necessity of the division of part of India into Pakistan."

      content: "It is not a religious faith. Religious faith you can -c-han-g—e, but real dharma you cannot change. Try to understand Krsna. In the Bhagavad-gita [18.66] He says, sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekath garanath vraja: Give up all other forms of religion and just surrender to Me. That is real knowl-edge—to surrender to the Supreme. You or I—anyone—is surrendered to someone. That is a fact. Our life is by surrender, is it not? Do you disagree with this point? Prof. Kotovsky: To some extent you surrender. §rila Prabhupacla: Yes, to the full extent. Prof. Kotovsky: You have to surrender to the society, for instance. To the whole people. §rila Prabhupacla: Yes, to the whole people, or to the state or to the king or the government or whatever you say. This surrender must be there. Prof. Kotovsky: The only difficulty is that we cannot half surrender to a government or a king. The principal difference is of surrender to a king, to a person, or to the society. §rila Prabhupacla: No, that is only a change of color. But the principle of surrender is there. Whether you surrender to monarchy, demoracy, ar-istocracy, or dictatorship, you have to surrender; that is a fact. cWithout surrender there is no life. It is not possible. So we are educating people to surrender to the Supreme, wherefrom you get all protection, just as Krsna says (sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam §arahath vraja). No one can say, No, I am not surrendered to anyone. Not a single person. The difference is where he surrenders. The ultimate surrendering object is Krsna. There-to in the Bhagavad-gita [7.19] Krsna says, bahanartz janmanam ante frianavcin re  math prapadyate: After surrendering to so many things birth after birth, when one is factually wise he surrenders unto Me. Vasudevait sarvam iti sa mahatma sudurlabhah: Such a mahatma is very rare. Prof. Kotovsky: But at the same time it seems to me that surrender is to be accompanied by revolt. The history of mankind has proved that mankind has developed only by revolt against some kind of surrender the medieval age there was the French Revolution. It was revolt against  surrender. But this revolution itself was surrender to the rank and file of the people. You are agreed? Srila Prabhupada: Yes. Prof. Kotovsky: So it is not enough to come to a full stop. Surrender is to be accompanied with revolt against some and surrender to other people,. Prabhupada: But the surrender will be fully stopped when it is surrender to Krsna. . .  Prof. Kotovsky: Ah, ah. Prabhupicia: That is full stop—no more surrender. Any other sur-render you have to change by revolution. But when you come to Krsna, then it is sufficient. You are satisfied. I'll give you an example: a child is crying, and people move him from one lap to another. Oh, he does not stop. But as soon as the baby comes to the lap of his mother—Prof. Kotovsky: It stops. Srila Prabhupada: Yes, full satisfaction. So this surrender, these changes, will go on in different categories. But the sum total of all this surrender is surrender to maya. Therefore, in the Bhagavad-gita it is said that this sur-render, neglecting Krsna, is all maya. Either you surrender to this or to that, but final surrender is surrender to Krsna; then you will be happy. The process of surrender is there, but surrender to Krsna keeps one quite satisfied, transcendentally."

      content: "Srila Prabhupada: No, no. This is organized by the Englishmen and Americans. The Indian communities in London and San Francisco are trying to become—you know the word? Sahib? Prof. Kotovsky: [Laughs.] Westernized. [They both laugh.] A very great social anthropologist at the university has written something very inter-esting. He says there are two processes—the process of Westernization among bra-hirianas, mainly the upper class, and the process called Sanskritization, which is the process of adopting brahmana rituals, etc., by so-called lower classes, even untouchables. It is a very interesting process in India just now. But India's position, unfortunately, is problematic. Srila Prabhupada: The difficulty is that India is nowhere. They are trying to imitate Western life, but from a materialistic or technical point of view, they are one hundred years back. Prof. Kotovsky: Yes, that is right. But what to do for India? Srila Prabhupada: There is one thing I am experiencing. If India's spiri-tual asset is distributed, that will increase India's honor. Because every-where I go, people still adore Indian culture. If this treasure-house of India's spiritual knowledge is properly distributed, at least people outside of India will understand that they are getting something from India. Prof. Kotovsky: Of course, you're right. The Indian cultural heritage is to be made known everywhere. But at the same time, in what way would this benefit the Indian masses themselves? They are sitting in India, and they have nothing to gain from the spreading of the Indian cultural heritage all over the world. Indian villages have to have fertilizers, tractors, etc. Srila Prabhupada: Yes, we do not object to that."

They simply observe and then speak nonsense. Scientists say that the chemicals are the cause of life."

      content: "'BUILD YOUR NATIONS ON THE SPIRITUAL PLATFORM' Srila Prabhupada addresses students, faculty, and government officials at the University of Nairobi in September 1972: 'You are trying to develop yourselves so please develop spiritually, for spiritual development is sound development' Don't imitate the Americans and Europeans, who are living like cats an'd dogs. . . . The atomic bomb is already there, and as soon as the next war breaks out, all their skyscrapers and everything else will be finished. Try to understand this from the real viewpoint of human life, the spiritual viewpoint.' Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for kindly coming here to participate in this meeting for spreading Ki-sna consciousness. The Krsna consciousness movement is trying to bring human society to the point where everyone's life can become successful. The subject today is the real meaning of human life. We are trying to instruct the entire world about this meaning. Human life is attained after many, many millions of years species of life according to the Padma Purana. Life began with the aquatics, for we can understand from Vedic literature that at the beginning of creation the entire planet was merged in water. This material world is composed of five gross elements—earth, water, fire, air, and ether. Besides these there are three subtle elements—mind, intelligence, and ego. Behind these curtains is the spirit soul, which is covered by these eight elements. This informa-tion is given in the Bhagavad-gita. Human beings are not the only living entities to have a spirit soul. We are all spirit souls—beasts, birds, reptiles, insects, trees, plants, aquatics, and so on. The spirit soul is simply covered by different dresses, just as some of you are dressed in white clothes, some in green, some in red, etc. But we are not concerned with the dress; we are concerned with you as spirit soul. Thus it is said in the Bhagavad-gita [5.18]."

      content: "In Vedic scriptures such as the Narada-paricartitra and the Srimad Bhfigavatam. These two books, and the Bhagavad-gita, are very authentic scriptures meant for devotees. Caitanya Mahaprabhu quotes from a versa in the Mirada-pan-carat/7r hrsikeija hrsike§a-sevanarh bhaktir ucyate. This i the definition of pure devotional service. Hrsikena hrsikega-sevanam. Hrsikena means 'by one's senses.' We have to engage our senses; it is not that we engage only our minds. If someone says, 'I am always thinking of Krsna' that is not pure devotional service. Meditation is thinking, but no one thinks of Krsna; they think of void or something impersonal. If someone is thinking of Krsna or Narayana or Visnu, as prescribed in the Vedic scriptures, that is real yoga; yoga meditation means to focus one's mind upon the Supersoul. The Supersoul is the representation of Krsna in the form of four-handed Narayana. Even Patatijali, an authority on the yoga system, prescribes meditation on Visnu. But just as people are manu-facturing bogus religious processes, the so-called yogis of today have manufactured their own way of thinking of something void. But the Narada-paficartitra says, hrsikena hrsike§a-sevanam: one must engage not only one's mind but one's senses. Engage the senses in the service of the master of the senses. These three Sanskrit words are very significant. Hrsikena means 'the Lord of the senses.' So bhakti-yoga means to serve with the senses the Lord of the senses. The Lord of the senses is Krsna. We should always remember that we have our senses because we wanted to enjoy this material world, and therefore the Lord has given us a particular set of senses for our enjoyment. "

      content: "REACHING LIFE'S PERFECTION 277 Prahlada Maharaja was offered whatever he liked, he had only to ask for it, but he said, 'My Lord, I am Your eternal servant. It is my duty to serve You, so how can I accept any benefit from it? Then I would not be Your servant; I would be a merchant.' He replied in that way, and that is the sign of a pure person. Krsna is so kind that He fulfills all the desires of a devotee, even if he wants material benedictions. If at the bot-tom of the devotee's heart there is some desire, He also fulfills that. He is so kind. But the sublime position of bhakti-yoga, or devotional service, is that a pure devotee refuses to accept the various kinds of liberation, even if offered by the Supreme Lord. If one has material desires or motives within himself, and for fulfill-ment of such desires he engages himself in devotional service, the result will be that he will never get pure love of God."

      content: "Rupa Gosvami was very glad that Krsna had sent so many things and that he could now prepare a feast. He pi pared a feast and then invited his elder brother. When Sanatana Gosvami came, he was astonished. 'How have yc secured such things? You have prepared such a nice feast in this fore5 How is it possible?' So Riipa Gosvami explained, 'In the morning I desired for it, and b chance Krsna sent me all these things. A nice girl came, and she offere it to me.' He was describing the girl: 'A very nice girl.' Then Sanatana said, 'This nice girl is Radharani. You have taken servic from Radharani, the Lord's eternal consort. It is a great blunder.' That i their philosophy. They would not accept service from the Lord. They sim ply wanted to render service. But Krsna is so clever that He also wants tc serve His devotee. He looks for an opportunity to serve His devotee. Thi! is spiritual competition. A pure devotee does not want anything from Krsna; he simply wants to serve Him. And Krsna also looks for the oppor-tunity to serve His devotee. Krsna is always as anxious to please His devo-tee as the devotee is to please Him. This is the transcendental world. On the absolute plane, there is no exploitation. Everyone wants to serve; no one wants to take service. In the transcendental world, everyone wants to give service. You want to give service to me, and I want to give service to you. This is such a nice attitude. This material world means that I want to pickpocket you, and you want to pickpocket me. That's all. This is the material world. We should try to understand it. In the material world, everyone wants to exploit his friend, his father, his mother, everyone. But in the transcendental world, every-e wants to serve. Everyone has Krsna as the central point of serving."

      content: "A pure devotee's position is that he has no enemy because he is not envious. A pure devo-tee is always open to everyone, and he does not discriminate that this person can be allowed to chant Hare Krsna and that person should not be allowed. On the material platform, which is a platform of dualism, there are differences between high and low, man and woman, and this or that, but on the spiritual platform there are no such distinctions. The pure devotee, seeing everything with an equal mind, is therefore nonenvious. Because he is nonenvious, he is worshipable. Indeed, it may even be said that a person is worshipable simply if he is nonenvious, for it is only possible to be nonenvious on the spiritual platform. This is also the ver-dict of the Bhagavad-gita [5.18-19]: 'vidya-vinaya-sampanne brahmane gavi hastini guni caiva §vapake ca panclitalj sama-darginah ihaiva tair jitatj sargo yesarh samye sthitarh manalj nirdosarii hi samarh brahma tasmad brahmani to sthiteilj' The humble sages, by virtue of true knowledge, see with equal vision a learned and gentle brahmana, a cow, an elephant, a dog, and a dog-eater. Those whose minds are established in sameness and equanimity have already conquered the conditions of birth and death. They are flawless like Brahman, and thus they are already situated in Brahman.'"

      content: "Therefore Krsna says that worship of His devotee is even more valuable than worship of Him-self. The devotee is actually able to deliver Krsna, for he knows the science of Krsna consciousness, the science of hearing Krsna's words, eating krsna-prasaadam, and enjoying Krsna."

      content: "The underlying principle of devotional service is unalloyed love for Krsna. Regardless of the position of a particular devotee—as friend, ser-vant, parent, or lover of Krsna—his service is unconditional, for Krsna consciousness is not dependent on any material condition. It is transcen-dental and has nothing to do with the modes of material nature. A devo-tee is not afraid to go anywhere, and because of this he sees all material conditions as equal. In the world we may say that this is a good place to be and that is a bad place, but, as pointed out before, the devotee is not subject to these mental concoctions. For him the basic principle of ma-terial existence is bad, for material existence means forgetfulness of Krsna."

      content: "REACHING LIFE'S PERFECTION 287 One who realizes that God is full in six opulences actually begins rendering service. As soon as one becomes aware of the greatness of Krsna and understands Krsna's superiority, his service begins. The awareness of God's greatness increases when tran-scendental service is rendered. A person who serves the Lord in order to satisfy the senses of the Lord becomes satisfied, because Krsna is the Supersoul and the individual living entity is His part and parcel. If He is satisfied, then the living entity is satisfied. If the stomach is satisfied, then all the parts of the body are satisfied, for they receive nourishment through the stomach. When one of my Godbrothers began to fan my Guru Maharaja on a very hot day, Guru Maharaja asked, 'Why are you fanning me all of a sudden?' The boy replied, 'Because if you are satisfied, we are all satisfied.' This is the formula—we should not try to satisfy our senses separately, but should try to satisfy Krsna's senses. Then naturally we will become satisfied."

      content: "As far as the individual soul is concerned, it is originally a part and parcel of this pleasure potency, of the reservoir of pleasure Himself. However, due to contact with material nature, the soul has forgotten its actual position and has become trapped in the evolutionary process of transmigration from one body to another. Thus one struggles hard for existence. Now we must extricate ourselves from the sufferings of the struggle, from the countless transmigrations that force us to suffer the miseries of birth, old age, disease, and death, and come to the point of our eternal life in Krsna consciousness. That eternal life is possible. If one tries his best in this human form of life, in his next life he will get a spiritual body. The spiritual body is already within the gross material body, but it will develop only as soon as one becomes free from the contamination of this material existence. That is the aim of human life and the actual self-interest of all people. Self-interest is actually realizing, 'I am part and parcel of God. I have to return to the kingdom of God and join with Him.' Just as we have a social life here, God has a social life in the spiritual king-dom, and we can join Him there. It is not that after finishing this body we become void. In the Bhagavad-gita [2.12] Krsna told Arjuna, 'Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings, nor in the future shall any of us cease to be.' Our existence is therefore eternal, and the changes of birth and death are simply the changes of the temporary material bodies."

      content: "AN INTRODUCTION TO ISKCON 309 The basic principle of the Hare Krsna way of life is 'simple living and high thinking.' Devotees of Krsna are encour-aged to use their time, energy, talents, and resources in devotional service to God, and not to hanker for selfish ambitions or pleasures, which result in frustration and anxiety. To cultivate their inherent spiritual qualities of compassion, truthful-ness, cleanliness, and austerity, devotees follow four regulative principles, which also help them control the insatiable urges of the mind and senses. These principles are: 1. No eating of meat, fish, or eggs. 2. No gambling. 3. No sex other than for procreation within marriage. 4. No intoxicants, including all recreational drugs, alcohol, tobacco, tea, and coffee. According to the Bhagavad-gita and other Vedic literature, indulgence in the above activities disrupts our physical, mental, and spiritual well-being and increases anxiety and conflict in society."
    - page: "9"
      content: "A Philosophy for Everyone The philosophy of the Hare Krsna movement (a monotheistic tradition) is summarized in the following eight points: 1. By sincerely cultivating the authentic spiritual science presented in the Bhagavad-gita and other Vedic scriptures, we can become free from anxiety and achieve a state of pure, unending, blissful consciousness. 2. Each of us is not the material body but an eternal spirit soul, part and parcel of God (Krsna). As such, we are all the eternal servants of Krsna and are interrelated through Him, our common father. 3. Krsna is the eternal, all-knowing, omnipresent, all-powerful, and all-attractive Personality of Godhead. He is the seed-giving father of all living beings and the sustaining energy of the universe. He is the source of all incarnations of God, including Lord Buddha and Lord Jesus Christ. 4. The Vedas are the oldest scriptures in the world. The essence of the Vedas is found in the Bhagavad-gita, a literal record of Krsna's words spoken five thousands years ago in India. The goal of Vedic knowledge—and of all religions—is to achieve love of God. 5. We can perfectly understand the knowledge of self-realization through the instructions of a genuine spiritual master—one who is free from selfish motives, who teaches the science of God explained in the Bhagavad-gita, and whose mind is firmly fixed in meditation on Krsna. 6. All that we eat should first be offered to Lord Krsna with a prayer. In this way Krsna accepts the offering and blesses it for our purification. 7. Rather than living in a self-centered way, we should act for the plea-sure of Lord Krsna. This is known as bhakti-yoga, the science of devotional service. 8. The most effective means for achieving God consciousness in this Age of Kali, or quarrel, is to chant the holy names of the Lord: Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare."

Limiting WIP also makes it easier to see problems that prevent the completion of work.[†] For instance, when we limit WIP, we find that we may have nothing to do because we are waiting on someone else. Although it may be tempting to start new work (i.e., “It’s better to be doing something than nothing'), a far better action would be to find something than nothing'), a far better action would be to find out what is causing the delay and help fix that problem. Bad multitasking often occurs when people are assigned to multiple projects, resulting in many prioritization problems. In other words, as David J. Andersen, author of Kanban: Successful Evolutionary Change for Your Technology Business, quipped, “Stop starting. Start finishing.'"

It prevents the work center from starting new work, which will likely introduce new errors into the system. If the problem is not addressed, the work center could potentially have the same problem in the next operation (e.g., fifty-five seconds later), requiring more fixes and work. See Appendix 6. This practice of swarming seems contrary to common management practice, as we are deliberately allowing a local problem to disrupt operations globally. However, swarming enables learning. Changes that pass our continuous build and integration tests are deployed into production, and any changes that cause any tests to fail trigger our Andon cord and are swarmed until resolved. Astonishingly, when the number of Andon cord pulls drop, plant managers will actually decrease the tolerances to get an increase in the number of Andon cord pulls in order to continue to enable more learnings and improvements and to detect ever-weaker failure signals."

We put the database administrators in one group, the network administrators in another, the server administrators in a third, and so forth. One of the most visible consequences of this is long lead times. The problem is exacerbated when each Operations functional area has to serve multiple value streams (i.e., multiple Development teams) who all compete for their scarce cycles. In order for Development teams to get their work done in a timely manner, we often have to escalate issues to a manager or director, and eventually to someone (usually an executive) who can finally prioritize the work against the global organizational goals instead of the functional silo goals. This decision must then get cascaded down into each of the functional areas to change the local priorities, and this, in turn, slows down other teams. When every team expedites their work, the net result is that every project ends up moving at the same slow crawl."

This model has been adopted by Amazon and Netflix and is touted by Amazon as one of the primary reasons behind their ability to move fast even as they grow. For example, high performance with a functional-oriented and centralized Operations group is possible, as long as service teams get what they need from Operations reliably and quickly (ideally on demand) and vice-versa. Many of the most admired DevOps organizations retain functional orientation of Operations, including Etsy, Google, and GitHub."

But why does using version control for our environments predict IT and organizational performance better than using version control for our code?

Consequently, it is the environment that needs to be in version control the most."

The latter pattern is what has become known as immutable infrastructure, where manual changes to the production environment are no longer allowed—the only way production changes can be made is to put the changes into version control and re-create the code and environments from scratch. By doing this, no variance is able to creep into production.

This is one of many practices that demonstrate how Operations can make developers far more productive. We enforce the practice of developers running their code in production-like environments by incorporating it into the definition of 'done.' Furthermore, by putting all production artifacts into version control, we have a 'single source of truth' that allows us to re-create the entire production environment in a quick, repeatable, and documented way, using the same development practices for Operations work as we do for Development work. And by making production infrastructure easier to rebuild than to repair, we make resolving problems easier and faster, as well as making it easier to expand capacity."

However, they are two distinct actions that serve two very different purposes: Deployment is the installation of a specified version of software to a given environment (e.g., deploying code into an integration test environment or deploying code into production). Specifically, a deployment may or may not be associated with a release of a feature to customers. Release is when we make a feature (or set of features) available to all our customers or a segment of customers (e.g., we enable the feature to be used by 5% of our customer base). Our code and environments should be architected in such a way that the release of functionality does not require changing our application code."  
    - page: "12"
      content: "There are two broad categories of release patterns we can use: Environment-based release patterns: This is where we have two or more environments that we deploy into, but only one environment is receiving live customer traffic (e.g., by configuring our load balancers). New code is deployed into a non-live environment, and the release is performed moving traffic to this environment. These are extremely powerful patterns, because they typically require little or no change to our applications. These patterns include blue-green deployments, canary releases, and cluster immune systems, all of which will be discussed shortly. Application-based release patterns: This is where we modify our application so that we can selectively release and expose specific application functionality by small configuration changes. For instance, we can implement feature flags that progressively expose new functionality in production to the development team, all internal employees, 1% of our customers, or, when we are confident that the release will operate as designed, our entire customer base. As discussed earlier, this enables a technique called dark launching, where we stage all the functionality to be launched in production and test it with production traffic before our release. For instance, we may invisibly test our new functionality with production traffic for weeks before our launch in order to expose problems so that they can be fixed before our actual launch."

      content: "Decoupling deployments from our releases dramatically changes how we work.

      content: "The Blue-Green Deployment Pattern The simplest of the three patterns is called blue-green deployment. In this pattern, we have two production environments: blue and green. At any time, only one of these is serving customer traffic—in figure 20, the green environment is live. Figure 20: Blue-green deployment patterns (Source: Humble and North, Continuous Delivery, 261.) To release a new version of our service, we deploy to the inactive environment where we can perform our testing without interrupting the user experience. When we are confident that everything is functioning as designed, we execute our release by directing traffic to the blue environment. Thus, blue becomes live and green becomes staging. Roll back is performed by sending customer traffic back to the green environment."

      content: "His updated definitions of continuous delivery and continuous deployment are as follows: When all developers are working in small batches on trunk, or everyone is working off trunk in short-lived feature branches that get merged to trunk regularly, and when trunk is always kept in a releasable state, and when we can release on demand at the push of a button during normal business hours, we are doing continuous delivery. Developers get fast feedback when they introduce any regression errors, which include defects, performance issues, security issues, usability issues, etc. When these issues are found, they are fixed immediately so that trunk is always deployable. In addition to the above, when we are deploying good builds into production on a regular basis through self-service (being deployed by Dev or by Ops)—which typically means that we are deploying to production at least once per day per developer, or perhaps even automatically deploying every change a developer commits—this is when we are engaging in continuous deployment. Defined this way, continuous delivery is the prerequisite for continuous deployment—just as continuous integration is a prerequisite for continuous delivery. Continuous deployment is likely applicable in the context of web services that are delivered online."

By doing this, we can reduce our deployment lead times from months to minutes, allowing our organizations to quickly deliver value to our customer without causing chaos and disruption. Furthermore, by having Dev and Ops work together, we can finally make Operations work humane."

In other words, when something goes wrong with something in our environment, we need to know exactly what applications and services could be or are being affected.[††] In decades past, creating links between a service and the production infrastructure it depended on was often a manual effort (such as ITIL CMDBs or creating configuration definitions inside alerting tools in tools such as Nagios). However, increasingly these links are now registered automatically within our services, which are then dynamically discovered and used in production through tools such as Zookeeper, Etcd, Consul, etc."

      content: "CONCLUSION The improvements enabled by production telemetry from Etsy and LinkedIn show us how critical it is to see problems as they occur, so we can search out the cause and quickly remedy the situation. By having all elements of our service emitting telemetry that can be analyzed, whether it is in our application, database, or in our environment, and making that telemetry widely available, we can find and fix problems long before they cause something catastrophic, ideally long before a customer even notices that something is wrong. The result is not only happier customers, but, by reducing the amount of firefighting and crises when things go wrong, we have a happier and more productive workplace with less stress and lower levels of burnouts."

Then, after each user-visible outage, we’d ask what indicators would have predicted that outage and then add those to our monitoring system, alerting as needed. Repeat. Now we only have alerts that prevent outages, as opposed to being bombarded by alerts after an outage already occurred."

      content: "In this step, we will replicate the outcomes of such an exercise. One of the easiest ways to do this is to analyze our most severe incidents in the recent past (e.g., 30 days) and create a list of telemetry that could have enabled earlier and faster detection and diagnosis of the problem, as well as easier and faster confirmation that an effective fix had been implemented. For instance, if we had an issue where our NGINX web server stopped responding to requests, we would look at the leading indicators that could have warned us earlier that we were starting to deviate from standard operations, such as: Application level: increasing web page load times, etc. OS level: server free memory running low, disk space running low, etc. Database level: database transaction times taking longer than normal, etc. Network level: number of functioning servers behind the load balancer dropping, etc. Each of these metrics is a potential precursor to a production incident. For each, we would configure our alerting systems to notify them when they deviate sufficiently from the mean, so that we can take corrective action."

Scryer works by predicting what customer demands will be based on historical usage patterns and provisions the necessary capacity. Scryer addressed three problems with AAS. The first was dealing with rapid spikes in demand. Because AWS instance startup times can be ten to forty-five minutes, additional compute capacity was often delivered too late to deal with spikes in demand. The second problem was that after outages, the rapid decrease in customer demand led to AAS removing too much compute capacity to handle future incoming demand. The third problem was that AAS didn’t factor in known usage traffic patterns when scheduling compute capacity."

The purpose of presenting this case study here is not as a tutorial, but to demonstrate how a class of statistical techniques can be used in our work, as well as how it’s likely being used in our organizations in completely different applications."

Ideally, we would also want to be alerted that the data has drifted from our expected Monday pattern. Even saying ‘Kolmogorov-Smirnov’ is a great way to impress everyone, Dr. Boubez jokes. But what Ops engineers should tell statisticians is that these types of non-parametric techniques are great for Operations data, because it makes no assumptions about normality or any other probability distribution, which is crucial for us to understand what’s going on in our very complex systems. These techniques compare two probability distributions, allowing us to compare periodic or seasonal data, which helps us find variances in data that varies from day to day or week to week."

[§] Tools we can using to solve these types of problems include Microsoft Excel (which remains one of the easiest and fastest ways to manipulate data for one-time purposes), as well as statistical packages such as SPSS, SAS, and the open source R project, now one of the most widely used statistical packages. Many other tools have been created, including several that Etsy has open-sourced, such as Oculus, which finds graphs with similar shapes that may indicate correlation; Opsweekly, which tracks alert volumes and frequencies; and Skyline, which attempts to identify anomalous behavior in system and application graphs."

      content: "CONCLUSION In this chapter, we explored several different statistical techniques that can be used to analyze our production telemetry so we can find and fix problems earlier than ever, often when they are still small and long before they cause catastrophic outcomes. This enables us to find ever-weaker failure signals that we can then act upon, creating an ever safer system of work, as well as increasing our ability to achieve our goals. Specific case studies were presented, including how Netflix used these techniques to proactively remove compute servers from production and auto-scale their compute infrastructure. We also discussed how to use a moving average and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov filter, both of which can be found in popular telemetry graphing tools. In the next chapter, we will describe how to integrate production telemetry into the daily work of Development in order to make deployments safer and improve the system as a whole."

Eventually, when someone is brave enough to volunteer to push their code into production, inevitably, due to incorrect assumptions or production subtleties that weren’t fully appreciated, the first production deployment doesn’t go smoothly—and because we don’t have enough production telemetry, we only find out about the problems when customers tell us. To fix the problem, our team urgently fixes the code and pushes it into production, but this time with more production telemetry added to our applications and environment. This way, we can actually confirm that our fix restored service correctly, and we’ll be able to detect this type of problem before a customer tells us next time. Later, more developers start to push their own code into production. And because we’re working in a complex system, we’ll still probably break something in production, but this time we’ll be able to quickly see what functionality broke, and quickly decide whether to roll back or fix-forward, resolving the problem. This is a huge victory for the entire team and everyone celebrates—we’re now on a roll."

This is when the product team watches a customer use the application in their natural environment, often working at their desk. Doing so often uncovers startling ways that customers struggle with the application, such as requiring scores of clicks to perform simple tasks in their daily work, cutting and pasting text from multiple screens, or writing down notes on paper. All of these are examples of compensatory behaviors and workarounds for usability issues. The most common reaction for developers after participating in a customer observation is dismay, often stating how awful it was seeing the many ways we have been inflicting pain on our customers. These customer observations almost always result in significant learning and a fervent desire to improve the situation for the customer."

      content: "By creating launch guidance, we help ensure that every product team benefits from the cumulative and collective experience of the entire organization, especially Operations. Launch guidance and requirements will likely include the following: Defect counts and severity: Does the application actually perform as designed? Type/frequency of pager alerts: Is the application generating an unsupportable number of alerts in production? Monitoring coverage: Is the coverage of monitoring sufficient to restore service when things go wrong? System architecture: Is the service loosely-coupled enough to support a high rate of changes and deployments in production? Deployment process: Is there a predictable, deterministic, and sufficiently automated process to deploy code into production? Production hygiene: Is there evidence of enough good production habits that would allow production support to be managed by anyone else? Superficially, these requirements may appear similar to traditional production checklists we have used in the past. However, the key differences are we require effective monitoring to be in place, deployments to be reliable and deterministic, and an architecture that supports fast and frequent deployments. If any deficiencies are found during the review, the assigned Ops engineer should help the feature team resolve the issues or even help re-engineer the service if necessary, so that it can be easily deployed and managed in production. At this time, we may also want to learn whether this service is subject to any regulatory compliance objectives or if it is likely to be in the future: Does the service generate a significant amount of revenue? (For example, if it is more than 5% of total revenue of a publicly-held US corporation, it is a significant account and in-scope for compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 [SOX].) Does the service have high user traffic or have high outage/impairment costs? (i.e., do operational issues risk creating availability or reputational risk?) Does the service store payment cardholder information, such as credit card numbers, or personally identifiable information, such as Social Security numbers or patient care records? Are there other security issues that could create regulatory, contractual obligation, privacy, or reputation risk? Does the service have any other regulatory or contractual compliance requirements associated with it, such as US export regulations, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and so forth? This information helps ensure that we effectively manage not only the technical risks associated with this service, but also any potential security and compliance risks. It also provides essential input into the design of the production control environment."

By creating these feedback loops, we make production deployments safer, increase the production readiness of code created by Development, and help create a better working relationship between Development and Operations by reinforcing shared goals, responsibilities, and empathy.

We should then perform the cheapest and fastest experiments possible to validate through user research whether the intended feature will actually achieve the desired outcomes.

They experimented with modifying and adapting the offer, re-wording the offer, varying the copywriting styles, design and typography, packaging, and so forth, to determine which was most effective in generating the desired action (e.g., calling a phone number, ordering a product)."

In other words, two-thirds of features either have a negligible impact or actually make things worse.

If we are not performing user research, the odds are that two-thirds of the features we are building deliver zero or negative value to our organization, even as they make our codebase ever more complex, thus increasing our maintenance costs over time and making our software more difficult to change. Furthermore, the effort to build these features is often made at the expense of delivering features that would deliver value (i.e., opportunity cost).

Techniques such as hypothesis-driven development, defining and measuring out customer acquisition funnel, and A/B testing allow us to perform user-experiments safely and easily, enabling us to unleash creativity and innovation, and create organizational learning. And, while succeeding is important, the organizational learning that comes from experimentation also gives employees ownership of business objectives and customer satisfaction. In the next chapter, we examine and create review and coordination processes as a way to increase the quality of our current work."

They pioneered the process called pull request, one of the most popular forms of peer review that span Dev and Ops."

      content: "Scott Chacon, CIO and co-founder of GitHub, wrote on his website that pull requests are the mechanism that lets engineers tell others about changes they have pushed to a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is sent, interested parties can review the set of changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary. Engineers submitting a pull request will often request a +1, +2, or so forth, depending on how many reviews they need, or @mention engineers that they’d like to get reviews from. At GitHub, pull requests are also the mechanism used to deploy code into production through a collective set of practices they call GitHub Flow—it’s how engineers request code reviews, gather and integrate feedback, and announce that code will be deployed to production (i.e., master branch)."        
    - page: "18"
      content: "GitHub Flow is composed of five steps: To work on something new, the engineer creates a descriptively named branch off of master (e.g., new-oauth2-scopes). The engineer commits to that branch locally, regularly pushing their work to the same named branch on the server. When they need feedback or help, or when they think the branch is ready for merging, they open a pull request. When they get their desired reviews and get any necessary approvals of the feature, the engineer can then merge it into master. Once the code changes are merged and pushed to master, the engineer deploys them into production. These practices, which integrate review and coordination into daliy work, have allowed GitHub to quickly and reliably deliver features to market with high quality and security. For example, in 2012 they performed an amazing 12,602 deployments. In particular, on August 23rd, after a company-wide summit where many exciting ideas were brainstormed and discussed, the company had their busiest deployment day of the year, with 563 builds and 175 successful deployments into production, all made possible through the pull request process."

      content: "THE DANGERS OF CHANGE APPROVAL PROCESSES The Knight Capital failure is one of the most prominent software deployment errors in recent memory. A fifteen minute deployment error resulted in a $440 million trading loss, during which the engineering teams were unable to disable the production services. The financial losses jeopardized the firm’s operations and forced the company to be sold over the weekend so they could continue operating without jeopardizing the entire financial system. John Allspaw observed that when high-profile incidents occur, such as the Knight Capital deployment accident, there are typically two counterfactual narratives for why the accident occurred."        
    - page: "18"
      content: "The first narrative is that the accident was due to a change control failure, which seems valid because we can imagine a situation where better change control practices could have detected the risk earlier and prevented the change from going into production. And if we couldn’t prevent it, we might have taken steps to enable faster detection and recovery. The second narrative is that the accident was due to a testing failure. This also seems valid, with better testing practices we could have identified the risk earlier and canceled the risky deployment, or we could have at least taken steps to enable faster detection and recovery. The surprising reality is that in environments with low-trust, command-and-control cultures, the outcomes of these types of change control and testing countermeasures often result in an increased likelihood that problems will occur again, potentially with even worse outcomes. Gene Kim (co-author of this book) describes his realization that change and testing controls can potentially have the opposite effect than intended as one of the most important moments of my professional career. This ‘aha’ moment was the result of a conversation in 2013 with John Allspaw and Jez Humble about the Knight Capital accident, making me question some of my core beliefs that I’ve formed over the last ten years, especially having been trained as an auditor. He continues, However upsetting it was, it was also a very formative moment for me. Not only did they convince me that they were correct, we tested these beliefs in the 2014 State of DevOps Report, which led to some astonishing findings that reinforce that building high-trust cultures is likely the largest management challenge of this decade."

      content: "Counterfactual thinking is a term used in psychology that involves the human tendency to create possible alternatives to life events that have already occurred.

      content: "One of the core beliefs in the Toyota Production System is that people closest to a problem typically know the most about it. This becomes more pronounced as the work being performed and the system the work occurs in become more complex and dynamic, as is typical in DevOps value streams. In these cases, creating approval steps from people who are located further and further away from the work may actually reduce the likelihood of success. As has been proven time and again, the further the distance between the person doing the work (i.e., the change implementer) and the person deciding to do the work (i.e., the change authorizer), the worse the outcome."

      content: "In Puppet Labs’ 2014 State of DevOps Report, one of the key findings was that high-performing organizations relied more on peer review and less on external approval of changes.

      content: "For all these reasons, we need to create effective control practices that more closely resemble peer review, reducing our reliance on external bodies to authorize our changes.

    - page: "18"
      content: "ENABLE PEER REVIEW OF CHANGES Instead of requiring approval from an external body prior to deployment, we may require engineers to get peer reviews of their changes. In Development, this practice has been called code review, but it is equally applicable to any change we make to our applications or environments, including servers, networking, and databases. The goal is to find errors by having fellow engineers close to the work scrutinize our changes. This review improves the quality of our changes, which also creates the benefits of cross-training, peer learning, and skill improvement. A logical place to require reviews is prior to committing code to trunk in source control, where changes could potentially have a team-wide or global impact. At a minimum, fellow engineers should review our change, but for higher risk areas, such as database changes or business-critical components with poor automated test coverage, we may require further review from a subject matter expert (e.g., information security engineer, database engineer) or multiple reviews (e.g., +2 instead of merely +1)."        
    - page: "18"
      content: "The principle of small batch sizes also applies to code reviews. The larger the size of the change that needs to be reviewed, the longer it takes to understand and the larger the burden on the reviewing engineer. As Randy Shoup observed, There is a non-linear relationship between the size of the change and the potential risk of integrating that change—when you go from a ten line code change to a one hundred line code, the risk of something going wrong is more than ten times higher, and so forth. This is why it’s so essential for developers to work in small, incremental steps rather than on long-lived feature branches."        
    - page: "18"
      content: "Furthermore, our ability to meaningfully critique code changes goes down as the change size goes up. As Giray Özil tweeted, Ask a programmer to review ten lines of code, he’ll find ten issues. Ask him to do five hundred lines, and he’ll say it looks good. Guidelines for code reviews include: Everyone must have someone to review their changes (e.g., to the code, environment, etc.) before committing to trunk. Everyone should monitor the commit stream of their fellow team members so that potential conflicts can be identified and reviewed. Define which changes qualify as high risk and may require review from a designated subject matter expert (e.g., database changes, security-sensitive modules such as authentication, etc.).[§] If someone submits a change that is too large to reason about easily—in other words, you can’t understand its impact after reading through it a couple of times, or you need to ask the submitter for clarification—it should be split up into multiple, smaller changes that can be understood at a glance."        
    - page: "18"
      content: "Code reviews come in various forms: Pair programming: programmers work in pairs (see section below) Over-the-shoulder: One developer looks over the author’s shoulder as the latter walks through the code. Email pass-around: A source code management system emails code to reviewers automatically after the code is checked in. Tool-assisted code review: Authors and reviewers use specialized tools designed for peer code review (e.g., Gerrit, GitHub pull requests, etc.) or facilities provided by the source code repositories (e.g., GitHub, Mercurial, Subversion, as well as other platforms such as Gerrit, Atlassian Stash, and Atlassian Crucible). Close scrutiny of changes in many forms is effective in locating errors previously overlooked."

As noted earlier in this book, Eran Messeri described that in 2013 the processes at Google enabled over thirteen thousand developers to work off of trunk on a single source code tree, performing over 5,500 code commits per week, resulting in hundreds of production deployments per week. In 2010, there were 20+ changes being checked in to trunk every minute, resulting in 50% of the codebase being changed every month. This requires considerable discipline from Google team members and mandatory code reviews, which cover the following areas: Code readability for languages (enforces style guide) Ownership assignments for code sub-trees to maintain consistency and correctness Code transparency and code contributions across teams"

When testing failures occur, our typical reaction is to do more testing. However, if we are merely performing more testing at the end of the project, we may worsen our outcomes. This is especially true if we are doing manual testing, because manual testing is naturally slower and more tedious than automated testing and performing additional testing often has the consequence of taking significantly longer to test, which means we are deploying less frequently, thus increasing our deployment batch size. And we know from both theory and practice that when we increase our deployment batch size, our change success rates go down and our incident counts and MTTR go up—the opposite of the outcome we want. Instead of performing testing on large batches of changes that are scheduled around change freeze periods, we want to fully integrate testing our daily work as part of the smooth and continual flow into production, and increase our deployment frequency. By doing this, we build in quality, which allows us to test, deploy, and release in ever smaller batch sizes."

      content: "ENABLE PAIR PROGRAMMING TO IMPROVE ALL OUR CHANGES Pair programming is when two engineers work together at the same workstation, a method popularized by Extreme Programming and Agile in the early 2000s. As with code reviews, this practice started in Development but is equally applicable to the work that any engineer does in our value stream. In this book, we will use the term pairing and pair programming interchangeably, to indicate that the practice is not just for developers. In one common pattern of pairing, one engineer fills the role of the driver, the person who actually writes the code, while the other engineer acts as the navigator, observer, or pointer, the person who reviews the work as it is being performed. While reviewing, the observer may also consider the strategic direction of the work, coming up with ideas for improvements and likely future problems to address. This frees the driver to focus all of his or her attention on the tactical aspects of completing the task, using the observer as a safety net and guide. When the two have differing specialties, skills are transferred as an automatic side effect, whether it’s through ad-hoc training or by sharing techniques and workarounds."        
    - page: "18"
      content: "Another pair programming pattern reinforces test-driven development (TDD) by having one engineer write the automated test and the other engineer implement the code. Jeff Atwood, one of the founders of Stack Exchange, wrote, I can’t help wondering if pair programming is nothing more than code review on steroids….The advantage of pair programming is its gripping immediacy: it is impossible to ignore the reviewer when he or she is sitting right next to you. He continued, Most people will passively opt out [of reviewing code] if given the choice. With pair programming, thats not possible. Each half of the pair has to understand the code, right then and there, as its being written. Pairing may be invasive, but it can also force a level of communication that youd otherwise never achieve."

      content: "Dr. Laurie Williams performed a study in 2001 that showed paired programmers are 15% slower than two independent individual programmers, while ‘error-free code increased from 70% to 85%. Since testing and debugging are often many times more costly than initial programming, this is an impressive result. Pairs typically consider more design alternatives than programmers working alone and arrive at simpler, more maintainable designs; they also catch design defects early. Dr. Williams also reported that 96% of her respondents stated that they enjoyed their work more when they programmed in pairs than when they programmed alone.[¶] Pair programming has the additional benefit of spreading knowledge throughout the organization and increasing information flow within the team. Having more experienced engineers review while the less experienced engineer codes is also an effective way to teach and be taught."

      content: "Another method comes from Ryan Tomayko, CIO and co-founder of GitHub and one of the inventors of the pull request process. When asked to describe the difference between a bad pull request and a good pull request, he said it has little to do with the production outcome. Instead, a bad pull request is one that doesnt have enough context for the reader, having little or no documentation of what the change is intended to do. For example, a pull request that merely has the following text: Fixing issue #3616 and #3841.[**] That was an actual internal GitHub pull request, which Tomayko critiqued, This was probably written by a new engineer here. First off, no specific engineers were specifically @mentioned—at a minimum, the engineer should have mentioned their mentor or a subject matter expert in the area that theyre modifying to ensure that someone appropriate reviews their change. Worse, there isnt any explanation of what the changes actually are, why its important, or exposing any of the implementers thinking. On the other hand, when asked to describe a great pull request that indicates an effective review process, Tomayko quickly listed off the essential elements: there must be sufficient detail on why the change is being made, how the change was made, as well as any identified risks and resulting countermeasures. Tomayko also looks for good discussion of the change, enabled by all the context that the pull request provided—often, there will be additional risks pointed out, ideas on better ways to implement the desired change, ideas on how to better mitigate the risk, and so forth. And if something bad or unexpected happens upon deployment, it is added to the pull request, with a link to the corresponding issue. All discussion happens without placing blame; instead, there is a candid conversation on how to prevent the problem from recurring in the future. As an example, Tomayko produced another internal GitHub pull request for a database migration. It was many pages long, with lengthy discussions about the potential risks, leading up to the following statement by the pull request author: I am pushing this now. Builds are now failing for the branch, because of a missing column in the CI servers. (Link to Post-Mortem: MySQL outage) The change submitter then apologized for the outage, describing what conditions and mistaken assumptions led to the accident, as well as a list of proposed countermeasures to prevent it from happening again. This was followed by pages and pages of discussion. Reading through the pull request, Tomayko smiled, Now that is a great pull request."

      content: "CONCLUSION In this chapter, we discussed how to integrate practices into our daily work that increase the quality of our changes and reduce the risk of poor deployment outcomes, reducing our reliance on approval processes. Case studies from GitHub and Target show that these practices not only improve our outcomes, but also significantly reduce lead times and increase developer productivity. To do this kind of work requires a high-trust culture. Consider a story that John Allspaw told about a newly hired junior engineer: The engineer asked if it was okay to deploy a small HTML change, and Allspaw responded, I dont know, is it? He then asked Did you have someone review your change? Do you know who the best person to ask is for changes of this type? Did you do everything you absolutely could to assure yourself that this change operates in production as designed? If you did, then dont ask me—just make the change! By responding this way, Allspaw reminded the engineer that she was solely responsibility for the quality of her change—if she did everything she felt she could to give herself confidence that the change would work, then she didnt need to ask anyone for approval, she should make the change. Creating the conditions that enable change implementers to fully own the quality of their changes is an essential part of the high-trust, generative culture we are striving to build. Furthermore, these conditions enable us to create an ever-safer system of work, where we are all helping each other achieve our goals, spanning whatever boundaries necessary to get there."

However, prior to Columbias re-entry, a handful of mid-level NASA engineers had reported this incident, but their voices had gone unheard. They observed the foam strike on video monitors during a post-launch review session and immediately notified NASAs managers, but they were told that the foam issue was nothing new.

They describe how organizations are typically structured in one of two models: a standardized model, where routine and systems govern everything, including strict compliance with timelines and budgets, or an experimental model, where every day every exercise and every piece of new information is evaluated and debated in a culture that resembles a research and design (R&D) laboratory. They observe, Firms get into trouble when they apply the wrong mind-set to an organization [which dictates how they respond to ambiguous threats or, in the terminology of this book, weak failure signals]....By the 1970s, NASA had created a culture of rigid standardization, promoting to Congress the space shuttle as a cheap and reusable spacecraft. NASA favored strict process compliance instead of an experimental model where every piece of information needed to be evaluated as it occured without bias. The absence of continuous learning and experimentation had dire consequences. The authors conclude that it is culture and mind-set that matters, not just being careful—as they write, vigilance alone will not prevent ambiguous threats [weak failure signals] from turning into costly (and sometimes tragic) failures."

He continues, I was talking with a co-worker about a massive outage we just had at Netflix—it was caused by, frankly, a dumb mistake. In fact, it was caused by an engineer who had taken down Netflix twice in the last eighteen months. But, of course, this is a person wed never fire. In that same eighteen months, this engineer moved the state of our operations and automation forward not by miles but by light-years. That work has enabled us to do deployments safely on a daily basis, and has personally performed huge numbers of production deployments.

During that time, theyve simulated an earthquake in Silicon Valley, which resulted in the entire Mountain View campus being disconnected from Google; major data centers having complete loss of power; and even aliens attacking cities where engineers resided. As Krishnan wrote, An often-overlooked area of testing is business process and communications. Systems and processes are highly intertwined, and separating testing of systems from testing of business processes isnt realistic: a failure of a business system will affect the business process, and conversely a working system is not very useful without the right personnel. Some of the learnings gained during these disasters included: When connectivity was lost, the failover to the engineer workstations didnt work Engineers didnt know how to access a conference call bridge or the bridge only had capacity for fifty people or they needed a new conference call provider who would allow them to kick off engineers who had subjected the entire conference to hold music When the data centers ran out of diesel for the backup generators, no one knew the procedures for making emergency purchases through the supplier, resulting in someone using a personal credit card to purchase $50,000 worth of diesel. By creating failure in a controlled situation, we can practice and create the playbooks we need. One of the other outputs of Game Days is that people actually know who to call and know who to talk to—by doing this, they develop relationships with people in other departments so they can work together during an incident, turning conscious actions into unconscious actions that are able to become routine."

When treated properly, errors that are inherent in complex systems can create a dynamic learning environment where all of the shareholders feel safe enough to come forward with ideas and observations, and where groups rebound more readily from projects that dont perform as expected. Both blameless post-mortems and injecting production failures reinforce a culture that everyone should feel both comfortable with and responsible for surfacing and learning from failures. In fact, when we sufficiently reduce the number of accidents, we decrease our tolerance so that we can keep learning. As Peter Senge is known to say, The only sustainable competitive advantage is an organizations ability to learn faster than the competition."

The problem is that engineers who are building new applications or environments often dont know that these documents exist, or they dont have the time to implement the documented standards. The result is they create their own tools and processes, with all the disappointing outcomes wed expect: fragile, insecure, and unmaintainable applications and environments that are expensive to run, maintain, and evolve. Instead of putting our expertise into Word documents, we need to transform these documented standards and processes, which encompass the sum of our organizational learnings and knowledge, into an executable form that makes them easier to reuse.

You can write a tool exactly once and have it be usable for all projects. You have 100% accurate knowledge of who depends on a library; therefore, you can refactor it and be 100% sure of who will be affected and who needs to test for breakage. I could probably list one hundred more examples. I cant express in words how much of a competitive advantage this is for Google."

And yet, DevOps may be one of the best ways to better integrate information security into the daily work of everyone in the technology value stream."
    - page: "22"
      content: "One interpretation of DevOps is that it came from the need to enable developers productivity, because as the number of developers grew, there werent enough Ops people to handle all the resulting deployment work. This shortage is even worse in Infosec—the ratio of engineers in Development, Operations, and Infosec in a typical technology organization is 100:10:1. When Infosec is that outnumbered, without automation and integrating information security into the daily work of Dev and Ops, Infosec can only do compliance checking, which is the opposite of security engineering—and besides, it also makes everyone hate us."

      content: "INTEGRATE SECURITY INTO DEVELOPMENT ITERATION DEMONSTRATIONS One of our goals is to have feature teams engaged with Infosec as early as possible, as opposed to primarily engaging at the end of the project. One way we can do this is by inviting Infosec to the product demonstrations at the end of each development interval so that they can better understand the team goals in the context of organizational goals, observe their implementations as they are being built, and provide guidance and feedback at the earliest stages of the project, when there is the most amount of time and freedom to make corrections."

      content: "Instead of performing these tests manually, we would ideally generate them as part of our automated unit or functional tests so that they can be run continuously in our deployment pipeline. As part of our testing, we will want to include the following: Static analysis: This is testing that we perform in a non-runtime environment, ideally in the deployment pipeline. Typically, a static analysis tool will inspect program code for all possible run-time behaviors and seek out coding flaws, back doors, and potentially malicious code (this is sometimes known as testing from the inside-out). Examples of tools include Brakeman, Code Climate, and searching for banned code functions (e.g., exec()). Dynamic analysis: As opposed to static testing, dynamic analysis consists of tests executed while a program is in operation. Dynamic tests monitor items such as system memory, functional behavior, response time, and overall performance of the system. This method (sometimes known as testing from the outside-in) is similar to the manner in which a malicious third party might interact with an application. Examples include Arachni and OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy). Some types of penetration testing can also be performed in an automated fashion and should be included as part of dynamic analysis using tools such as Nmap and Metasploit. Ideally, we should perform automated dynamic testing during the automated functional testing phase of our deployment pipeline, or even against our services while they are in production. To ensure correct security handling, tools like OWASP ZAP can be configured to attack our services through a web browser proxy and inspect the network traffic within our test harness. Dependency scanning: Another type of static testing we would normally perform at build time inside of our deployment pipeline involves inventorying all our dependencies for binaries and executables, and ensuring that these dependencies, which we often dont have control over, are free of vulnerabilities or malicious binaries. Examples include Gemnasium and bundler audit for Ruby, Maven for Java, and the OWASP Dependency-Check. Source code integrity and code signing: All developers should have their own PGP key, perhaps created and managed in a system such as keybase.io. All commits to version control should be signed­—that is straightforward to configure using the open source tools gpg and git. Furthermore, all packages created by the CI process should be signed, and their hash recorded in the centralized logging service for audit purposes."

      content: "Effective change management policies will recognize that there are different risks associated with different types of changes and that those changes are all handled differently. These processes are defined in ITIL, which breaks changes down into three categories:"
    - page: "23"
      content: "Standard changes: These are lower-risk changes that follow an established and approved process, but can also be pre-approved. They include monthly updates of application tax tables or country codes, website content and styling changes, and certain types of application or operating system patches that have a well-understood impact. The change proposer does not require approval before deploying the change, and change deployments can be completely automated and should be logged so there is traceability."
    - page: "23"
      content: "Normal changes: These are higher-risk changes that require review or approval from the agreed upon change authority. In many organizations, this responsibility is inappropriately placed on the change advisory board (CAB) or emergency change advisory board (ECAB), which may lack the required expertise to understand the full impact of the change, often leading to unacceptably long lead times. This problem is especially relevant for large code deployments, which may contain hundreds of thousands (or even millions) of lines of new code, submitted by hundreds of developers over the course of several months. In order for normal changes to be authorized, the CAB will almost certainly have a well-defined request for change (RFC) form that defines what information is required for the go/no-go decision. The RFC form usually includes the desired business outcomes, planned utility and warranty, a business case with risks and alternatives, and a proposed schedule."
    - page: "23"
      content: "Urgent changes: These are emergency, and, consequently, potentially high risk, changes that must be put into production immediately (e.g., urgent security patch, restore service). These changes often require senior management approval, but allow documentation to be performed after the fact."

They also started to routinely perform destructive testing, a term used in manufacturing to refer to performing prolonged endurance testing under the most severe operating conditions until the component being tested is destroyed. Unsurprisingly, the result was significantly higher service quality with normal production loads."

Our goal is to create alternative methods of presenting the data that clearly show auditors that our controls are operating and effective."
    - page: "23"
      content: "To help bridge that gap, he has teams work with auditors in the control design process. They use an iterative approach, assigning a single control for each sprint to determine what is needed in terms of audit evidence. This has helped ensure that auditors get the information they need when the service is in production, entirely on demand."
    - page: "23"
      content: "Shinn states that the best way to accomplish this is to send all data into our telemetry systems, such as Splunk or Kibana. This way auditors can get what they need, completely self-serviced. They dont need to request a data sample—instead, they log into Kibana, and then search for audit evidence they need for a given time range. Ideally, theyll see very quickly that theres evidence to support that our controls are working."

      content: "Shinn continues, With modern audit logging, chat rooms, and deployment pipelines, theres unprecedented visibility and transparency into whats happening in production, especially compared to how Operations used to be done, with far lower probability of errors and security flaws being introduced.

Instead, they should be relying on production monitoring controls in addition to using automated testing, code reviews, and approvals, to effectively mitigate the risks associated with errors and fraud."

      content: "CONCLUSION Throughout this chapter, we have discussed practices that make information security everyones job, where all of our information security objectives are integrated into the daily work of everyone in the value stream. By doing this, we significantly improve the effectiveness of our controls, so that we can better prevent security breaches, as well as detect and recover from them faster. And we significantly reduce the work associated with preparing and passing compliance audits."

      content: "PART VI CONCLUSION Throughout the previous chapters, we explored how to take DevOps principles and apply them to Information Security, helping us achieve our goals, and making sure security is a part of everyones job, every day. Better security ensures that we are defensible and sensible with our data, that we can recover from security problems before they become catastrophic, and, most importantly, that we can make the security of our systems and data better than ever."

      content: "A Call to Action—Conclusion to the DevOps Handbook We have come to the end"
    - page: "23"
      content: "As we have explored throughout The DevOps Handbook, we know that, left unmanaged, an inherent conflict can exist between Development and Operations that creates ever-worsening problems,which results in slower time to market for new products and features, poor quality, increased outages and technical debt, reduced engineering productivity, as well as increased employee dissatisfaction and burnout."
    - page: "23"
      content: "DevOps requires potentially new cultural and management norms, and changes in our technical practices and architecture. This requires a coalition that spans business leadership, Product Management, Development, QA, IT Operations, Information Security, and even Marketing, where many technology initiatives originate. When all these teams work together, we can create a safe system of work, enabling small teams to quickly and independently develop and validate code that can be safely deployed to customers. This results in maximizing developer productivity, organizational learning, high employee satisfaction, and the ability to win in the marketplace."
    - page: "23"
      content: "Our goal in writing this book was to sufficiently codify DevOps principles and practices so that the amazing outcomes achieved within the DevOps community could be replicated by others. We hope to accelerate the adoption of DevOps initiatives and support their successful implementations while lowering the activation energy required for them to be completed."
    - page: "23"
      content: "We know the dangers of postponing improvements and settling for daily work-arounds, as well as the difficulties of changing how we prioritize and perform our daily work. Furthermore, we understand the risks and effort required to get organizations to embrace a different way of working, as well as the perception that DevOps is another passing fad, soon to replaced by the next buzzword."
    - page: "23"
      content: "We assert that DevOps is transformational to how we perform technology work, just as Lean forever transformed how manufacturing work was performed in the 1980s. Those that adopt DevOps will win in the marketplace, at the expense of those that do not. They will create energized and continually learning organizations that out-perform and out-innovate their competitors."
    - page: "23"
      content: "Because of this, DevOps is not just a technology imperative, but also an organizational imperative. The bottom line is, DevOps is applicable and relevant to any and all organizations that must increase flow of planned work through the technology organization, while maintaining quality, reliability, and security for our customers."
    - page: "23"
      content: "Our call to action is this: no matter what role you play in your organization, start finding people around you who want to change how work is performed. Show this book to others and create a coalition of like-minded thinkers to break out of the downward spiral. Ask organizational leaders to support these efforts, or, better yet, sponsor and lead these efforts yourself."
    - page: "23"
      content: "Finally, since youve made it this far, we have a dirty secret to reveal. In many of our case studies, following the achievement of the breakthrough results presented, many of the change agents were promoted—but, in some cases, there was later a change of leadership which resulted in many of the people involved leaving, accompanied by a rolling back of the organizational changes they had created."

      content: "DevOps benefits all of us in the technology value stream, whether we are Dev, Ops, QA, Infosec, Product Owners, or customers. It brings joy back to developing great products, with fewer death marches. It enables humane work conditions with fewer weekends and missed holidays with our loved ones. It enables teams to work together to survive, learn, thrive, delight our customers, and help our organization succeed."

Their parents and their society manage to protect them from all the dangers that could have killed them: germs, starvation, violence, and so on. So this number 14 tells us that most families in Malaysia have enough food, their sewage systems dont leak into their drinking water, they have good access to primary health care, and mothers can read and write. It doesnt just tell us about the health of children. It measures the quality of the whole society."

Graphs showing levels of income, or tourism, or democracy, or access to education, health care, or electricity would all tell the same story: that the world used to be divided into two but isnt any longer. Today, most people are in the middle. There is no gap between the West and the rest, between developed and developing, between rich and poor. And we should all stop using the simple pairs of categories that suggest there is."

      content: "LEVEL 1. You start on Level 1 with $1 per day. Your five children have to spend hours walking barefoot with your single plastic bucket, back and forth, to fetch water from a dirty mud hole an hours walk away. On their way home they gather firewood, and you prepare the same gray porridge that youve been eating at every meal, every day, for your whole life—except during the months when the meager soil yielded no crops and you went to bed hungry. One day your youngest daughter develops a nasty cough. Smoke from the indoor fire is weakening her lungs. You cant afford antibiotics, and one month later she is dead. This is extreme poverty. Yet you keep struggling on. If you are lucky and the yields are good, you can maybe sell some surplus crops and manage to earn more than $2 a day, which would move you to the next level. Good luck! (Roughly 1 billion people live like this today.)"
    - page: "1"
      content: "LEVEL 2. Youve made it. In fact, youve quadrupled your income and now you earn $4 a day. Three extra dollars every day. What are you going to do with all this money? Now you can buy food that you didnt grow yourself, and you can afford chickens, which means eggs. You save some money and buy sandals for your children, and a bike, and more plastic buckets. Now it takes you only half an hour to fetch water for the day. You buy a gas stove so your children can attend school instead of gathering wood. When theres power they do their homework under a bulb. But the electricity is too unstable for a freezer. You save up for mattresses so you dont have to sleep on the mud floor. Life is much better now, but still very uncertain. A single illness and you would have to sell most of your possessions to buy medicine. That would throw you back to Level 1 again. Another three dollars a day would be good, but to experience really drastic improvement you need to quadruple again. If you can land a job in the local garment industry you will be the first member of your family to bring home a salary. (Roughly 3 billion people live like this today.)"
    - page: "1"
      content: "LEVEL 3. Wow! You did it! You work multiple jobs, 16 hours a day, seven days a week, and manage to quadruple your income again, to $16 a day. Your savings are impressive and you install a cold-water tap. No more fetching water. With a stable electric line the kids homework improves and you can buy a fridge that lets you store food and serve different dishes each day. You save to buy a motorcycle, which means you can travel to a better-paying job at a factory in town. Unfortunately you crash on your way there one day and you have to use money you had saved for your childrens education to pay the medical bills. You recover, and thanks to your savings you are not thrown back a level. Two of your children start high school. If they manage to finish, they will be able to get better-paying jobs than you have ever had. To celebrate, you take the whole family on its first-ever vacation, one afternoon to the beach, just for fun. (Roughly 2 billion people live like this today.)"

      content: "LEVEL 4. You have more than $64 a day. You are a rich consumer and three more dollars a day makes very little difference to your everyday life. Thats why you think three dollars, which can change the life of someone living in extreme poverty, is not a lot of money. You have more than twelve years of education and you have been on an airplane on vacation. You can eat out once a month and you can buy a car. Of course you have hot and cold water indoors. But you know about this level already. Since you are reading this book, Im pretty sure you live on Level 4. I dont have to describe it for you to understand. The difficulty, when you have always known this high level of income, is to understand the huge differences between the other three levels. People on Level 4 must struggle hard not to misunderstand the reality of the other 6 billion people in the world. (Roughly 1 billion people live like this today.)"

We love to dichotomize. Good versus bad. Heroes versus villains. My country versus the rest.

      content: "In most cases there is no clear separation of two groups, even if it seems like that from the averages.

    - page: "1"
      content: "Take Brazil, one of the worlds most unequal countries. The richest 10 percent in Brazil earns 41 percent of the total income. Disturbing, right? It sounds too high. We quickly imagine an elite stealing resources from all the rest. The media support that impression with images of the very richest—often not the richest 10 percent but probably the richest 0.1 percent, the ultra-rich—and their boats, horses, and huge mansions. Yes, the number is disturbingly high. At the same time, it hasnt been this low for many years."

Does it make sense to say that the infants situation is improving? Yes. Absolutely. Does it make sense to say it is bad? Yes, absolutely. Does saying things are improving imply that everything is fine, and we should all relax and not worry? No, not at all. Is it helpful to have to choose between bad and improving? Definitely not. Its both. Its both bad and better. Better, and bad, at the same time. That is how we must think about the current state of the world."

By the time he gets to the last of the 64 squares, he is owed 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 grains of rice: enough to cover the whole of India with a layer of rice 30 inches deep."

Many aspects of the world are best represented by curves shaped like an S, or a slide, or a hump, and not by a straight line."
    - page: "3"
      content: "In this chart, money and health go hand in hand. We dont know from just looking at the line which comes first or what the relationship is between the two. It might be that a healthy population produces more income. It might be that a rich population can afford better health."

      content: "What we do know from such a line is that in general where income is higher, health is better."
    - page: "3"
      content: "We can also find straight lines when we compare income levels with education, marriage age, and spending on recreation. More income goes hand in hand with longer average schooling, with women marrying later, and with a greater share of income going toward recreation."

      content: "S-Bends When we compare income with basic necessities like primary-level education or vaccination, we see S-shaped curves. They are low and flat at Level 1, then they rise quickly through Level 2, because above Level 1, countries can afford primary education and vaccination (the most cost-effective health intervention there is) for just about the entire population. Just as we will buy ourselves a fridge and a cell phone as soon as we can afford them, countries will invest in primary education and vaccination as soon as they can afford them. Then the curves flatten off at Levels 3 and 4. Everyone already has these things. The curves reach their maximum and stay there."
    - page: "3"
      content: "Slides The babies-per-woman curve looks like a slide in a playground. It starts flat, then, after a certain level of income, it slopes downward, and then it flattens out and stays quite low, just below two babies per woman."

      content: "Shifting away from income graphs for a moment, we see a similar shape for the cost of vaccinations. In basic math classes, we teach children to multiply. If an injection costs $10, whats the price of a million injections? UNICEF knows how to count but it has also saved millions of childrens lives by not accepting a straight line. It has negotiated huge contracts with pharmaceutical companies, in which the price is cut to the bare minimum in return for guaranteed long contracts. But when you have negotiated to the bottom price, you cant get lower. Thats another slide-shaped curve."

For example, the number of E. coli bacteria in a body can explode in just a few days because it can double every 12 hours: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 … The world of transport also contains many doubling patterns. As peoples incomes increase, the distance they travel each year keeps doubling. So does the share of their income that they spend on transport. On Level 4, transport is behind one-third of all CO2 emissions—which also double with income."

      content: "Most peoples incomes grow much slower than bacteria, unfortunately. Still, even if your income increases by only 2 percent a year, after 35 years it will have doubled. And then, if you maintain 2 percent growth, in another 35 years it will have doubled again. Over 200 years—if you lived that long—it would double six times, which is exactly what we saw in Swedens bubble trail in the last chapter, and which is typically the slow and steady way countries have moved from Level 1 to Level 4."

But with another $64 a day, you could build a pool or buy a summer house. Thats life-changing for you.
