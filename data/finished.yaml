      content: "It turns out that over the past two years, deep learning has totally rewritten our approach to machine translation. Deep learning researchers who know almost nothing about language translation are throwing together relatively simple machine learning solutions that are beating the best expert-built language translation systems in the world. The technology behind this breakthrough is called sequence-to-sequence learning. It’s very powerful technique that be used to solve many kinds problems. After we see how it is used for translation, we’ll also learn how the exact same algorithm can be used to write AI chat bots and describe pictures. Let’s go!"

      content: "Building a statistics-based translation system requires lots of training data where the exact same text is translated into at least two languages. This double-translated text is called parallel corpora. In the same way that the Rosetta Stone was used by scientists in the 1800s to figure out Egyptian hieroglyphs from Greek, computers can use parallel corpora to guess how to convert text from one language to another."
