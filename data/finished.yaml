      content: "Modern Face Recognition with Deep Learning:- Machine learning people call the 128 measurements of each face an embedding. Encoding our face image This process of training a convolutional neural network to output face embeddings requires a lot of data and computer power. Even with an expensive NVidia Telsa video card, it takes about 24 hours of continuous training to get good accuracy. But once the network has been trained, it can generate measurements for any face, even ones it has never seen before! So this step only needs to be done once. Lucky for us, the fine folks at OpenFace already did this and they published several trained networks which we can directly use. Thanks Brandon Amos and team!"

      content: "Language Translation with Deep Learning:- It turns out that over the past two years, deep learning has totally rewritten our approach to machine translation. Deep learning researchers who know almost nothing about language translation are throwing together relatively simple machine learning solutions that are beating the best expert-built language translation systems in the world. The technology behind this breakthrough is called sequence-to-sequence learning. It’s very powerful technique that be used to solve many kinds problems. After we see how it is used for translation, we’ll also learn how the exact same algorithm can be used to write AI chat bots and describe pictures. Let’s go!"

      content: "Parallel corpora: Building a statistics-based translation system requires lots of training data where the exact same text is translated into at least two languages. This double-translated text is called parallel corpora. In the same way that the Rosetta Stone was used by scientists in the 1800s to figure out Egyptian hieroglyphs from Greek, computers can use parallel corpora to guess how to convert text from one language to another."

      content: "RNN: But like most machine learning algorithms, neural networks are stateless. A recurrent neural network (or RNN for short) is a slightly tweaked version of a neural network where the previous state of the neural network is one of the inputs to the next calculation. This means that previous calculations change the results of future calculations!"

      content: "RNNs are useful any time you want to learn patterns in data. Because human language is just one big, complicated pattern, RNNs are increasingly used in many areas of natural language processing."
    - page: "5" 
      content: "Encoding: This is our encoding. It lets us represent something very complicated (a picture of a face) with something simple (128 numbers). Now comparing two different faces is much easier because we only have to compare these 128 numbers for each face instead of comparing full images. Guess what? We can do the same thing with sentences! We can come up with an encoding that represents every possible different sentence as a series of unique numbers. Because the RNN has a “memory” of each word that passed through it, the final encoding it calculates represents all the words in the sentence."
    - page: "5" 
      content: "Here’s where things get really cool! What if we took two RNNs and hooked them up end-to-end? The first RNN could generate the encoding that represents a sentence. Then the second RNN could take that encoding and just do the same logic in reverse to decode the original sentence again. Of course being able to encode and then decode the original sentence again isn’t very useful. But what if (and here’s the big idea!) we could train the second RNN to decode the sentence into Spanish instead of English? We could use our parallel corpora training data to train it to do that."

    - page: "6" 
      content: "To turn this sound wave into numbers, we just record of the height of the wave at equally-spaced points: This is called sampling. We are taking a reading thousands of times a second and recording a number representing the height of the sound wave at that point in time. That’s basically all an uncompressed .wav audio file is. CD Quality audio is sampled at 44.1khz (44,100 readings per second). But for speech recognition, a sampling rate of 16khz (16,000 samples per second) is enough to cover the frequency range of human speech."
    - page: "6"
      content: "But thanks to the Nyquist theorem, we know that we can use math to perfectly reconstruct the original sound wave from the spaced-out samples — as long as we sample at least twice as fast as the highest frequency we want to record."
    - page: "6"
      content: "Pre-processing our Sampled Sound Data: A spectrogram is cool because you can actually see musical notes and other pitch patterns in audio data. A neural network can find patterns in this kind of data more easily than raw sound waves. So this is the data representation we’ll actually feed into our neural network."

      content: "For a company like Google or Amazon, hundreds of thousands of hours of spoken audio recorded in real-life situations is gold. That’s the single biggest thing that separates their world-class speech recognition system from your hobby system. The whole point of putting Google Now! and Siri on every cell phone for free or selling $50 Alexa units that have no subscription fee is to get you to use them as much as possible. Every single thing you say into one of these systems is recorded forever and used as training data for future versions of speech recognition algorithms. That’s the whole game! Don’t believe me? If you have an Android phone with Google Now!, click here to listen to actual recordings of yourself saying every dumb thing you’ve ever said into it:"

      content: "And the fake bills are being accepted as valid again! So now the Discriminator has to look again at the real dollar and find a new way to tell it apart from the fake one. This back-and-forth game between the Generator and the Discriminator continues thousands of times until both networks are experts. Eventually the Generator is producing near-perfect counterfeits and the Discriminator has turned into a Master Detective looking for the slightest mistakes."

      content: "How to Intentionally Trick Neural Networks: A Look into the Future of Hacking - Researchers have recently shown that you can train your own substitute neural network to mirror another neural network by probing it to see how it behaves. Then you can use your substitute neural network to generate hacked images that still often fool the original network! This is called a black-box attack."
    - page: "8"
      content: "How do we defend against this? The short answer is that no one is entirely sure yet. Preventing these kinds of attacks is still an on-going area of research. The best way to keep up with the latest developments is by reading the cleverhans blog maintained by Ian Goodfellow and Nicolas Papernot, two of the most influential researchers in this area."
    - page: "8"
      content: "If you simply create lots of hacked images and include them in your training data set going forward, that seems to make your neural network more resistant to these attacks. This is called Adversarial Training and is probably the most reasonable defense to consider adopting right now."
    - page: "8"
      content: "Since we don’t have any final answers yet, its worth thinking about the scenarios where you are using neural networks so that you can at least lessen the risk that this kind of attack would cause damage your business."

      content: "Prof. Kotovsky: But by creating brahmanas from different social classes of society, you deny the old prescription of the Hindu scriptures. Srila Prabhupada: No, I establish it. Prof. Kotovsky: According to all scriptures—the Purtinas, etc.—everymember of one of these four classes of varnas has to be born within it. §rila Prabhupada: No, no, no, no. Prof. Kotovsky: That is the foundation of all the varnas- §rila Prabhupada: No, no. I am sorry. Prof. Kotovsky: The foundation of all the varnas- §rila PrabhupAda: You have spoken incorrectly. With great respect I be to submit that you are not speaking correctly. In the  Bhagavad-gita [4.13] it is stated, aitur-varnyarii mays srstath guna-karma-vibhagagah: These four orders of brahmanas, Icsatriyas, vain as, and gadras were created by Me according to quality and work. There is no mention of birth. Prof. Kotovsky: I agree withyou that this is the addition of later briihmanas who tried to perpetuate these qualities. Sala Prabhupada: That has killed theIndian culture. Otherwise there would have been no necessity of the division of part of India into Pakistan."

      content: "It is not a religious faith. Religious faith you can -c-han-g—e, but real dharma you cannot change. Try to understand Krsna. In the Bhagavad-gita [18.66] He says, sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekath garanath vraja: Give up all other forms of religion and just surrender to Me. That is real knowl-edge—to surrender to the Supreme. You or I—anyone—is surrendered to someone. That is a fact. Our life is by surrender, is it not? Do you disagree with this point? Prof. Kotovsky: To some extent you surrender. §rila Prabhupacla: Yes, to the full extent. Prof. Kotovsky: You have to surrender to the society, for instance. To the whole people. §rila Prabhupacla: Yes, to the whole people, or to the state or to the king or the government or whatever you say. This surrender must be there. Prof. Kotovsky: The only difficulty is that we cannot half surrender to a government or a king. The principal difference is of surrender to a king, to a person, or to the society. §rila Prabhupacla: No, that is only a change of color. But the principle of surrender is there. Whether you surrender to monarchy, demoracy, ar-istocracy, or dictatorship, you have to surrender; that is a fact. cWithout surrender there is no life. It is not possible. So we are educating people to surrender to the Supreme, wherefrom you get all protection, just as Krsna says (sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam §arahath vraja). No one can say, No, I am not surrendered to anyone. Not a single person. The difference is where he surrenders. The ultimate surrendering object is Krsna. There-to in the Bhagavad-gita [7.19] Krsna says, bahanartz janmanam ante frianavcin re  math prapadyate: After surrendering to so many things birth after birth, when one is factually wise he surrenders unto Me. Vasudevait sarvam iti sa mahatma sudurlabhah: Such a mahatma is very rare. Prof. Kotovsky: But at the same time it seems to me that surrender is to be accompanied by revolt. The history of mankind has proved that mankind has developed only by revolt against some kind of surrender the medieval age there was the French Revolution. It was revolt against  surrender. But this revolution itself was surrender to the rank and file of the people. You are agreed? Srila Prabhupada: Yes. Prof. Kotovsky: So it is not enough to come to a full stop. Surrender is to be accompanied with revolt against some and surrender to other people,. Prabhupada: But the surrender will be fully stopped when it is surrender to Krsna. . .  Prof. Kotovsky: Ah, ah. Prabhupicia: That is full stop—no more surrender. Any other sur-render you have to change by revolution. But when you come to Krsna, then it is sufficient. You are satisfied. I'll give you an example: a child is crying, and people move him from one lap to another. Oh, he does not stop. But as soon as the baby comes to the lap of his mother—Prof. Kotovsky: It stops. Srila Prabhupada: Yes, full satisfaction. So this surrender, these changes, will go on in different categories. But the sum total of all this surrender is surrender to maya. Therefore, in the Bhagavad-gita it is said that this sur-render, neglecting Krsna, is all maya. Either you surrender to this or to that, but final surrender is surrender to Krsna; then you will be happy. The process of surrender is there, but surrender to Krsna keeps one quite satisfied, transcendentally."

      content: "Srila Prabhupada: No, no. This is organized by the Englishmen and Americans. The Indian communities in London and San Francisco are trying to become—you know the word? Sahib? Prof. Kotovsky: [Laughs.] Westernized. [They both laugh.] A very great social anthropologist at the university has written something very inter-esting. He says there are two processes—the process of Westernization among bra-hirianas, mainly the upper class, and the process called Sanskritization, which is the process of adopting brahmana rituals, etc., by so-called lower classes, even untouchables. It is a very interesting process in India just now. But India's position, unfortunately, is problematic. Srila Prabhupada: The difficulty is that India is nowhere. They are trying to imitate Western life, but from a materialistic or technical point of view, they are one hundred years back. Prof. Kotovsky: Yes, that is right. But what to do for India? Srila Prabhupada: There is one thing I am experiencing. If India's spiri-tual asset is distributed, that will increase India's honor. Because every-where I go, people still adore Indian culture. If this treasure-house of India's spiritual knowledge is properly distributed, at least people outside of India will understand that they are getting something from India. Prof. Kotovsky: Of course, you're right. The Indian cultural heritage is to be made known everywhere. But at the same time, in what way would this benefit the Indian masses themselves? They are sitting in India, and they have nothing to gain from the spreading of the Indian cultural heritage all over the world. Indian villages have to have fertilizers, tractors, etc. Srila Prabhupada: Yes, we do not object to that."

      content: "Brahmananda Swami: Knowledge means that one must be able to dem-onstrate his theory. They should be able to show in their laboratories that life is caused by a combination of chemicals. Snla Prabhupada: Yes, the scientific method means first observation, then hypothesis, and then demonstration. But these scientists cannot demon-strate their hypothesis. They simply observe and then speak nonsense. Scientists say that the chemicals are the cause of life."

      content: "'BUILD YOUR NATIONS ON THE SPIRITUAL PLATFORM' Srila Prabhupada addresses students, faculty, and government officials at the University of Nairobi in September 1972: You are trying to develop yourselves so please develop spiritually, for spiritual development is sound development' Don't imitate the Americans and Europeans, who are living like cats an'd dogs. . . . The atomic bomb is already there, and as soon as the next war breaks out, all their skyscrapers and everything else will be finished. Try to understand this from the real viewpoint of human life, the spiritual viewpoint. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for kindly coming here to participate in this meeting for spreading Ki-sna consciousness. The Krsna consciousness movement is trying to bring human society to the point where everyone's life can become successful. The subject today is the real meaning of human life. We are trying to instruct the entire world about this meaning. Human life is attained after many, many millions of years species of life according to the Padma Purana. Life began with the aquatics, for we can understand from Vedic literature that at the beginning of creation the entire planet was merged in water. This material world is composed of five gross elements—earth, water, fire, air, and ether. Besides these there are three subtle elements—mind, intelligence, and ego. Behind these curtains is the spirit soul, which is covered by these eight elements. This informa-tion is given in the Bhagavad-gita. Human beings are not the only living entities to have a spirit soul. We are all spirit souls—beasts, birds, reptiles, insects, trees, plants, aquatics, and so on. The spirit soul is simply covered by different dresses, just as some of you are dressed in white clothes, some in green, some in red, etc. But we are not concerned with the dress; we are concerned with you as spirit soul. Thus it is said in the Bhagavad-gita [5.18]."
